		Hidden Markov Toolkit (HTK) 3.2.1

Use of this software is governed by a license agreement, the terms and
conditions of which are set forth in the file LICENSE in the
top-level HTK installation directory.  Please read this file carefully
as use of this software implies acceptance of the conditions described
therein.

Introduction
============

HTK is a toolkit for use in research into automatic speech recognition
and has been developed by the Speech Vision Robotics Group at the
Cambridge University Engineering Department (http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk) 
and Entropic Ltd (http://www.entropic.com).

Please visit the HTK homepage at the following address for more
information about HTK:

    http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/

A number of mailing lists have been established to help users build
and understand HTK, for details see

    http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/mailing/subscribe_mail.shtml


License
=======

HTK is made available free of charge and can be downloaded from the
website mentioned above. However it may not be redistributed,
i.e. you must register at the website and download it from
there. Details about the terms under which HTK is made available can
be found in the LICENSE file.


Compiling & Installing HTK under UNIX
=====================================

HTK consists of two libraries (built from the source code in HTKLib/
and HLMLib/) and a set of command line tools (in HTKTools/ and
HLMTools/).

The supplied makefiles require the following environment variables
to be set:

 CPU   current CPU type 
 HBIN  specifies location of executables $HBIN/bin.$CPU
 HTKCC Name of C compiler
 HTKCF C compiler options
 HTKLF Linker options

See the makefiles in HTKLib/, HTKTools/, HLMLib/ and HLMTools/ for
detailed information about how these are used. The directory env/
contains example settings of these variables for a range of Operating
Systems.

First build the library in HTKLib/ and then build the tools in
HTKTools/. The executables will be copied to the directory
$HBIN/bin.$CPU which should be added to your PATH.  Then you can build
the library in HLMLib/ and the tools in HLMTools/.  The executables
will again be copied to the directory $HBIN/bin.$CPU which should be
added to your PATH.

Please address questions regarding building HTK to
HTK-users@eng.cam.ac.uk

In a future version we will provide an autoconf based build system. 


Compiling & Installing HTK under Windows
========================================

HTK can be compiled under Windows using the Visual Studio C compiler
and the 'nmake' facility.  To do this, open a DOS or Command Prompt
window and cd to the htk directory.  Create a directory for the
executables

   > mkdir bin.win32

Then compile the HTK Library as follows

   > cd HTKLib
   > VCVARS32
   > nmake /f htk_htklib_nt.mkf all

Next cd to the HTKTools directory and make the tools

   > nmake /f htk_htktools_nt.mkf all

Change to the HLMLib directory and compile it

   > nmake /f htk_hlmlib_nt.mkf all

And finally change to the HLMTools directory and compile

   > nmake /f htk_hlmtools_nt.mkf all

This will store the final executables in the bin.win32 directory which
should be added to your path.

Notes

1) VCVARS32, nmake and the C compiler are usually stored in 
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin 
   This must be in your path.
2) The variables CPU,HBIN,HTKCC, etc are set directly in the Windows
   makefiles and any existing settings are ignored.


Testing the Installation
========================

Among the samples on the HTK website you'll find the HTKDemo package
that can be used to test your installation. See
http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/download.shtml for download instructions.

As an initial test of the installation please run the HTK
demonstration using the configuration file
HTKDemo/configs/monPlainM1S1.dcf. There is a README file in the
HTKDemo directory explaining the operation of the demonstration in
detail but, in short, you need to run the demonstration script passing
it the configuration file configs/monPlainM1S1.dcf as input. 
To test the language modelling tools you should follow the tutorial
in the HTK book, using the files in the LMTutorial/ directory.

Before running the demo make sure you have compiled all the HTK tools
and the executables are in your PATH, i.e. just typing 'HInit' at the
commandline prints a short usage summary. To run the demonstration
type:

$ cd HTKDemo
$ ./runDemo configs/monPlainM1S1.dcf

The recognition results obtained should match the following.

On the training set:
------------------------ Overall Results --------------------------
SENT: %Correct=0.00 [H=0, S=7, N=7]
WORD: %Corr=77.63, Acc=74.89 [H=170, D=37, S=12, I=6, N=219]
===================================================================

On the test set:
------------------------ Overall Results --------------------------
SENT: %Correct=0.00 [H=0, S=3, N=3]
WORD: %Corr=63.91, Acc=59.40 [H=85, D=35, S=13, I=6, N=133]
===================================================================

NB to run this demo under Windows you must have perl installed and you
need to invoke perl explicitly. See http://www.perl.org/ to download
the perl distribution. The script runDemo.pl should be used in place
of runDemo i.e. to run the test above type

 > perl runDemo.pl configs\monPlainM1S1.dcf
