             The HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) version 2.1           
                             release June 27, 2008


The HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/) has
been being developed by the HTS working group (see "Who we are" below) and 
others (see "Acknowledgments" in the separate file).  The training part of HTS
has been implemented as a modified version of the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit
(HTK) (http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/).  Major modifications which we have made to
HTK are listed below:
                                
 * Context clustering based on the MDL criterion (instead of ML)
 * Stream-dependent context clustering
 * Multi-space probability distribution (MSD) as state output
   PDFs (for F0 pattern modeling)
 * State duration modeling and clustering

Related publications about the techniques and algorithms used in HTS can be
found at http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Publications

The current version does not include any text analyzer but the Festival Speech
Synthesis System (http://www.festvox.org/festival/), DFKI MARY Text-to-Speech
System (http://mary.dfki.de/), or other text analyzers can be used with HTS.
Since version 1.1, HTS has included a small run-time synthesis engine called
hts_engine.  Its footprint is usually less than 5 Mbytes including HMMs.
Because the synthesis engine can run without the HTK library, users can develop
their own open or proprietary softwares using hts_engine.

This distribution comes with demo scripts for training speaker-dependent and 
speaker-adaptation systems using "CMU ARCTIC databases"
(http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/).  These demo scripts generate "voices" 
which can be used with Festival.  By applying the patch codes provided by DFKI
(http://mary.opendfki.de/wiki/HMMVoiceCreation), they can generate "voices"
which can be used with DFKI MARY.

Six HTS voices for Festival 1.96 trained by CMU ARCTIC databases are also
released with HTS version 2.1.  Each of HTS voices consists of HMMs trained by
the demo script, and can be used as a "voice" of Festival without any other HTS
tools.

***** Notes for Japanese speech synthesis *****

A demo script using the Nitech database for speech synthesis "Nitech Jp ATR503
m001" is also prepared for training Japanese voices.  Voices trained by the
demo script can be used on GalateaTalk, which is a speech synthesis module of an
open-source toolkit for anthropomorphic spoken dialogue agents developed in
Galatea project (http://hil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~galatea/), without any other HTS 
tools.

An HTS voice for GalateaTalk trained by the demo script is also released with
HTS version 2.1.
