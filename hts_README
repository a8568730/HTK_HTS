   The HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) version 2.1beta
                    release January 15, 2008


The HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System (HTS)
(http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/) has been being developed by the
HTS working group (see "Who we are" below) and others (see
"Acknowledgments" in the separate file).  The training part of
HTS was implemented as a modified version of the Hidden Markov
Model Toolkit (HTK) (http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/).  Major
modifications which we made to HTK are listed below:
                                
 - Context clustering based on MDL criterion (instead of ML one)
 - Stream-dependent context clustering
 - Multi-space probability distribution as state output
   probability (for pitch pattern modeling)
 - State duration modeling and clustering

Related publications about the techniques and algorithms used in
HTS can be found at http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Publications

The current version does not include any text analyzer but the
Festival Speech Synthesis System
(http://www.festvox.org/festival/) can be used as a text
analyzer.  Since version 1.1, HTS has included a small run-time
synthesis engine called hts_engine (less than 2 Mbytes including
HMMs).  Since the synthesis engine can run without the HTK
library, it is suitable for using on the Festival and other
applications.


This distribution comes with demo scripts for training
speaker-dependent and speaker-adaptation systems using "CMU
ARCTIC databases" (http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/).  These
demo scripts generate "voices" for Festival.

Six HTS voices for Festival 1.95 & 1.96 trained by CMU ARCTIC
databases are also released with HTS version 2.1beta.  Each of HTS
voices consists of HMMs trained by the demo script, and can be
used as a "voice" of Festival Speech Synthesis System without
any other HTS tools.

*** Notes for Japanese speech synthesis ***

A demo script using the Nitech database for speech synthesis
"Nitech Jp ATR503 m001" is also prepared for training Japanese
voices.  Voices trained by the demo script can be used on
GalateaTalk, which is a speech synthesis module of an
open-source toolkit for anthropomorphic spoken dialogue agents
developed in Galatea project
(http://hil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~galatea/), without any other HTS
tools.

An HTS voice for GalateaTalk trained by the demo script is also
released with HTS version 2.1beta.

                            Copying
****************************************************************

The basic core system of HTS version 2.1beta is released as a
patch code to HTK version 3.4.  The patch code is released under
a MIT-style license, without commercial restrictions.  However,
it should be noted that once you apply the patch to the HTK
source code, you must obey the license of HTK.

Although the patch code is free, we still offer no warranties
 and no maintenance.  We will continue to endeavor to fix bugs
and answer queries when can, but are not in a position to
guarantee it.  We will consider consultancy if desired, please
contacts us for details.

If you are using HTS version 2.1beta in commercial environment,
even though no license is required, we would be grateful if you
let us know as it helps justify ourselves to our various
sponsors.  We also strongly encourage you to

 * reference the use of HTS in any publications that use the
   software
 * report all bugs, where possible with bug fixes, that are
   found.
