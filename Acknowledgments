Acknowledgments

The following people and related organizations have contributed to the development of HTS in various ways. 
It is their work that makes it all possible. In no special order:

    * Keiichi Tokuda
      Overall concept and design.

    * Heiga Zen
      Throwing away all old codes of HTS and rewriting them as HTS version 1.0, 1.1, 1.1b, 1.1.1, 2.0, and 2.0.1. 
      He is the current maintainer of HTS.

    * Junichi Yamagishi
      Testing out various clustering and adaptation algorithms.

    * Takayoshi Yoshimura
      Development of the first version of HTS.

    * Masatsune Tamura
      Implementation of various speaker adaptation algorithms for HMM-based speech synthesis.

    * Shinji Sako
      Applying HMM-based speech synthesis to audio-visual speech.

    * Noboru Miyazaki
      Implementation of the first version of MSD-HMM trainer for pitch pattern modeling.

    * Tetsuya Yamada
      Testing out various HMM training algorithms for HMM-based speech synthesis.

    * Takashi Masuko
      Discussions in detail and implementing speech parameter generation algorithms.

    * Takao Kobayashi
