# Simple text conditioning script
# DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT IN AN EVALUATION SYSTEM!
# It makes lots of obvious mistakes and is included for
#  example purposes only.  It doesn't know that $12 should
#  be written as 12 DOLLARS or TWELVE DOLLARS, not just 12,
#  or that "Dr. Paul" is not "<s> DR </s> <s> PAUL </s>"

# What it DOES do is convert lowercase to uppercase and surround
#  sentences with <s> and </s> start/end tags.  It tries to be
#  vaguely intelligent with puncuation, so "This is 'okay,' I test-case our's!"
#  becomes "<s> THIS IS OKAY I TEST-CASE OUR'S </s>"
