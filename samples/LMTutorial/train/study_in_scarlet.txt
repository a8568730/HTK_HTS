<s> PART ONE BEING A REPRINT FROM THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN H. WATSON M. D. LATE OF THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT CHAPTER ONE MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES </s>
<s> IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT I TOOK MY DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF MEDICINE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND PROCEEDED TO NETLEY TO GO THROUGH THE COURSE PRESCRIBED FOR SURGEONS IN THE ARMY </s>
<s> HAVING COMPLETED MY STUDIES THERE I WAS DULY ATTACHED TO THE FIFTH NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILIERS AS ASSISTANT SURGEON </s>
<s> THE REGIMENT WAS STATIONED IN INDIA AT THE TIME AND BEFORE I COULD JOIN IT THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR HAD BROKEN OUT </s>
<s> ON LANDING AT BOMBAY I LEARNED THAT MY CORPS HAD ADVANCED THROUGH THE PASSES AND WAS ALREADY DEEP IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY </s>
<s> I FOLLOWED HOWEVER WITH MANY OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MYSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANDAHAR IN SAFETY WHERE I FOUND MY REGIMENT AND AT ONCE ENTERED UPON MY NEW DUTIES </s>
<s> THE CAMPAIGN BROUGHT HONOURS AND PROMOTION TO MANY BUT FOR ME IT HAD NOTHING BUT MISFORTUNE AND DISASTER </s>
<s> I WAS REMOVED FROM MY BRIGADE AND ATTACHED TO THE BERKSHIRES WITH WHOM I SERVED AT THE FATAL BATTLE OF MAIWAND </s>
<s> THERE I WAS STRUCK ON THE SHOULDER BY A JEZAIL BULLET WHICH SHATTERED THE BONE AND GRAZED THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY </s>
<s> I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE MURDEROUS GHAZIS HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DEVOTION AND COURAGE SHOWN BY MURRAY MY ORDERLY WHO THREW ME ACROSS A PACKHORSE AND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING ME SAFELY TO THE BRITISH LINES </s>
<s> WORN WITH PAIN AND WEAK FROM THE PROLONGED HARDSHIPS WHICH I HAD UNDERGONE I WAS REMOVED WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF WOUNDED SUFFERERS TO THE BASE HOSPITAL AT PESHAWAR </s>
<s> HERE I RALLIED AND HAD ALREADY IMPROVED SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK ABOUT THE WARDS AND EVEN TO BASK A LITTLE UPON THE VERANDA WHEN I WAS STRUCK DOWN BY ENTERIC FEVER THAT CURSE OF OUR INDIAN POSSESSIONS </s>
<s> FOR MONTHS MY LIFE WAS DESPAIRED OF AND WHEN AT LAST I CAME TO MYSELF AND BECAME CONVALESCENT I WAS SO WEAK AND EMACIATED THAT A MEDICAL BOARD DETERMINED THAT NOT A DAY SHOULD BE LOST IN SENDING ME BACK TO ENGLAND </s>
<s> I WAS DESPATCHED ACCORDINGLY IN THE TROOPSHIP ORONTES AND LANDED A MONTH LATER ON PORTSMOUTH JETTY WITH MY HEALTH IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED BUT WITH PERMISSION FROM A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THE NEXT NINE MONTHS IN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE IT </s>
<s> I HAD NEITHER KITH NOR KIN IN ENGLAND AND WAS THEREFORE AS FREE AS AIR OR AS FREE AS AN INCOME OF ELEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE A DAY WILL PERMIT A MAN TO BE </s>
<s> UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I NATURALLY GRAVITATED TO LONDON THAT GREAT CESSPOOL INTO WHICH ALL THE LOUNGERS AND IDLERS OF THE EMPIRE ARE IRRESISTIBLY DRAINED </s>
<s> THERE I STAYED FOR SOME TIME AT A PRIVATE HOTEL IN THE STRAND LEADING A COMFORTLESS MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE AND SPENDING SUCH MONEY AS I HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE FREELY THAN I OUGHT </s>
<s> SO ALARMING DID THE STATE OF MY FINANCES BECOME THAT I SOON REALIZED THAT I MUST EITHER LEAVE THE METROPOLIS AND RUSTICATE SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY OR THAT I MUST MAKE A COMPLETE ALTERATION IN MY STYLE OF LIVING </s>
<s> CHOOSING THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE I BEGAN BY MAKING UP MY MIND TO LEAVE THE HOTEL AND TAKE UP MY QUARTERS IN SOME LESS PRETENTIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE DOMICILE </s>
<s> ON THE VERY DAY THAT I HAD COME TO THIS CONCLUSION I WAS STANDING AT THE CRITERION BAR WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING ROUND I RECOGNIZED YOUNG STAMFORD WHO HAD BEEN A DRESSER UNDER ME AT BART'S </s>
<s> THE SIGHT OF A FRIENDLY FACE IN THE GREAT WILDERNESS OF LONDON IS A PLEASANT THING INDEED TO A LONELY MAN </s>
<s> IN OLD DAYS STAMFORD HAD NEVER BEEN A PARTICULAR CRONY OF MINE BUT NOW I HAILED HIM WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HE IN HIS TURN APPEARED TO BE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME </s>
<s> IN THE EXUBERANCE OF MY JOY I ASKED HIM TO LUNCH WITH ME AT THE HOLBORN AND WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER IN A HANSOM </s>
<s> QUOTE WHATEVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF WATSON QUOTE HE ASKED IN UNDISGUISED WONDER AS WE RATTLED THROUGH THE CROWDED LONDON STREETS </s>
<s> YOU ARE AS THIN AS A LATH AND AS BROWN AS A NUT </s>
<s> I GAVE HIM A SHORT SKETCH OF MY ADVENTURES AND HAD HARDLY CONCLUDED IT BY THE TIME THAT WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION </s>
<s> POOR DEVIL HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY AFTER HE HAD LISTENED TO MY MISFORTUNES </s>
<s> WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW </s>
<s> LOOKING FOR LODGINGS I ANSWERED </s>
<s> TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS TO WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET COMFORTABLE ROOMS AT A REASONABLE PRICE </s>
<s> QUOTE THAT'S A STRANGE THING QUOTE REMARKED MY COMPANION QUOTE YOU ARE THE SECOND MAN TODAY THAT HAS USED THAT EXPRESSION TO ME QUOTE </s>
<s> AND WHO WAS THE FIRST </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> A FELLOW WHO IS WORKING AT THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY UP AT THE HOSPITAL </s>
<s> HE WAS BEMOANING HIMSELF THIS MORNING BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GET SOMEONE TO GO HALVES WITH HIM IN SOME NICE ROOMS WHICH HE HAD FOUND AND WHICH WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSE </s>
<s> BY JOVE </s>
<s> I CRIED IF HE REALLY WANTS SOMEONE TO SHARE THE ROOMS AND THE EXPENSE I AM THE VERY MAN FOR HIM </s>
<s> I SHOULD PREFER HAVING A PARTNER TO BEING ALONE QUOTE </s>
<s> YOUNG STAMFORD LOOKED RATHER STRANGELY AT ME OVER HIS WINEGLASS </s>
<s> YOU DON'T KNOW SHERLOCK HOLMES YET HE SAID PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT CARE FOR HIM AS A CONSTANT COMPANION </s>
<s> WHY WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM </s>
<s> OH I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS ANYTHING AGAINST HIM </s>
<s> HE IS A LITTLE QUEER IN HIS IDEAS AN ENTHUSIAST IN SOME BRANCHES OF SCIENCE </s>
<s> AS FAR AS I KNOW HE IS A DECENT FELLOW ENOUGH </s>
<s> A MEDICAL STUDENT I SUPPOSE SAID I </s>
<s> QUOTE NO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE INTENDS TO GO IN FOR </s>
<s> I BELIEVE HE IS WELL UP IN ANATOMY AND HE IS A FIRST CLASS CHEMIST BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW HE HAS NEVER TAKEN OUT ANY SYSTEMATIC MEDICAL CLASSES </s>
<s> HIS STUDIES ARE VERY DESULTORY AND ECCENTRIC BUT HE HAS AMASSED A LOT OF OUT OF THE WAY KNOWLEDGE WHICH WOULD ASTONISH HIS PROFESSORS </s>
<s> DID YOU NEVER ASK HIM WHAT HE WAS GOING IN FOR </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> NO HE IS NOT A MAN THAT IT IS EASY TO DRAW OUT THOUGH HE CAN BE COMMUNICATIVE ENOUGH WHEN THE FANCY SEIZES HIM </s>
<s> I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM I SAID </s>
<s> IF I AM TO LODGE WITH ANYONE I SHOULD PREFER A MAN OF STUDIOUS AND QUIET HABITS </s>
<s> I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET TO STAND MUCH NOISE OR EXCITEMENT </s>
<s> I HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH IN AFGHANISTAN TO LAST ME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY NATURAL EXISTENCE </s>
<s> HOW COULD I MEET THIS FRIEND OF YOURS QUOTE </s>
<s> HE IS SURE TO BE AT THE LABORATORY RETURNED MY COMPANION </s>
<s> HE EITHER AVOIDS THE PLACE FOR WEEKS OR ELSE HE WORKS THERE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT </s>
<s> IF YOU LIKE WE WILL DRIVE ROUND TOGETHER AFTER LUNCHEON </s>
<s> CERTAINLY I ANSWERED AND THE CONVERSATION DRIFTED AWAY INTO OTHER CHANNELS </s>
<s> AS WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER LEAVING THE HOLBORN STAMFORD GAVE ME A FEW MORE PARTICULARS ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN WHOM I PROPOSED TO TAKE AS A FELLOW LODGER </s>
<s> YOU MUSTN'T BLAME ME IF YOU DON'T GET ON WITH HIM HE SAID I KNOW NOTHING MORE OF HIM THAN I HAVE LEARNED FROM MEETING HIM OCCASIONALLY IN THE LABORATORY </s>
<s> YOU PROPOSED THIS ARRANGEMENT SO YOU MUST NOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE QUOTE </s>
<s> IF WE DON'T GET ON IT WILL BE EASY TO PART COMPANY I ANSWERED </s>
<s> IT SEEMS TO ME STAMFORD I ADDED LOOKING HARD AT MY COMPANION THAT YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS OF THE MATTER </s>
<s> IS THIS FELLOW'S TEMPER SO FORMIDABLE OR WHAT IS IT </s>
<s> DON'T BE MEALYMOUTHED ABOUT IT </s>
<s> IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPRESS THE INEXPRESSIBLE HE ANSWERED WITH A LAUGH </s>
<s> HOLMES IS A LITTLE TOO SCIENTIFIC FOR MY TASTES IT APPROACHES TO COLD BLOODEDNESS </s>
<s> I COULD IMAGINE HIS GIVING A FRIEND A LITTLE PINCH OF THE LATEST VEGETABLE ALKALOID NOT OUT OF MALEVOLENCE YOU UNDERSTAND BUT SIMPLY OUT OF A SPIRIT OF INQUIRY IN ORDER TO HAVE AN ACCURATE IDEA OF THE EFFECTS </s>
<s> TO DO HIM JUSTICE I THINK THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT HIMSELF WITH THE SAME READINESS </s>
<s> HE APPEARS TO HAVE A PASSION FOR DEFINITE AND EXACT KNOWLEDGE QUOTE </s>
<s> VERY RIGHT TOO </s>
<s> YES BUT IT MAY BE PUSHED TO EXCESS </s>
<s> WHEN IT COMES TO BEATING THE SUBJECTS IN THE DISSECTING ROOMS WITH A STICK IT IS CERTAINLY TAKING RATHER A BIZARRE SHAPE </s>
<s> BEATING THE SUBJECTS </s>
<s> YES TO VERIFY HOW FAR BRUISES MAY BE PRODUCED AFTER DEATH </s>
<s> I SAW HIM AT IT WITH MY OWN EYES QUOTE </s>
<s> AND YET YOU SAY HE IS NOT A MEDICAL STUDENT </s>
<s> NUMBER </s>
<s> HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THE OBJECTS OF HIS STUDIES ARE </s>
<s> BUT HERE WE ARE AND YOU MUST FORM YOUR OWN IMPRESSIONS ABOUT HIM </s>
<s> AS HE SPOKE WE TURNED DOWN A NARROW LANE AND PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SIDE DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO A WING OF THE GREAT HOSPITAL </s>
<s> IT WAS FAMILIAR GROUND TO ME AND I NEEDED NO GUIDING AS WE ASCENDED THE BLEAK STONE STAIRCASE AND MADE OUR WAY DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR WITH ITS VISTA OF WHITEWASHED WALL AND DUNCOLOURED DOORS </s>
<s> NEAR THE FARTHER END A LOW ARCHED PASSAGE BRANCHED AWAY FROM IT AND LED TO THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY </s>
<s> THIS WAS A LOFTY CHAMBER LINED AND LITTERED WITH COUNTLESS BOTTLES </s>
<s> BROAD LOW TABLES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT WHICH BRISTLED WITH RETORTS TEST TUBES AND LITTLE BUNSEN LAMPS WITH THEIR BLUE FLICKERING FLAMES </s>
<s> THERE WAS ONLY ONE STUDENT IN THE ROOM WHO WAS BENDING OVER A DISTANT TABLE ABSORBED IN HIS WORK </s>
<s> AT THE SOUND OF OUR STEPS HE GLANCED ROUND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A CRY OF PLEASURE </s>
<s> I'VE FOUND IT </s>
<s> I'VE FOUND IT HE SHOUTED TO MY COMPANION RUNNING TOWARDS US WITH A TEST TUBE IN HIS HAND </s>
<s> QUOTE I HAVE FOUND A RE AGENT WHICH IS PRECIPITATED BY HAEMOGLOBIN AND BY NOTHING ELSE QUOTE </s>
<s> HAD HE DISCOVERED A GOLD MINE GREATER DELIGHT COULD NOT HAVE SHONE UPON HIS FEATURES </s>
<s> DOCTOR WATSON MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID STAMFORD INTRODUCING US </s>
<s> HOW ARE YOU HE SAID CORDIALLY GRIPPING MY HAND WITH A STRENGTH FOR WHICH I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT </s>
<s> YOU HAVE BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN I PERCEIVE </s>
<s> HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW THAT </s>
<s> I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT </s>
<s> NEVER MIND SAID HE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELFL THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT HAEMOGLOBIN </s>
<s> NO DOUBT YOU SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY OF MINE QUOTE </s>
<s> WHY MAN IT IS THE MOST PRACTICAL MEDICO LEGAL DISCOVERY FOR YEARS </s>
<s> DON'T YOU SEE THAT IT GIVES US AN INFALLIBLE TEST FOR BLOOD STAINS </s>
<s> COME OVER HERE NOW </s>
<s> HE SEIZED ME BY THE COAT SLEEVE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND DREW ME OVER TO THE TABLE AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN WORKING </s>
<s> LET US HAVE SOME FRESH BLOOD HE SAID DIGGING A LONG BODKIN INTO HIS FINGER AND DRAWING OFF THE RESULTING DROP OF BLOOD IN A CHEMICAL PIPETTE </s>
<s> NOW I ADD THIS SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD TO A LITRE OF WATER </s>
<s> YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE RESULTING MIXTURE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF PURE WATER </s>
<s> THE PROPORTION OF BLOOD CANNOT BE MORE THAN ONE IN A MILLION </s>
<s> I HAVE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CHARACTERISTIC REACTION </s>
<s> AS HE SPOKE HE THREW INTO THE VESSEL A FEW WHITE CRYSTALS AND THEN ADDED SOME DROPS OF A TRANSPARENT FLUID </s>
<s> IN AN INSTANT THE CONTENTS ASSUMED A DULL MAHOGAHY COLOUR AND A BROWNISH DUST WAS PRECIPITATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS JAR </s>
<s> QUOTE HA HA QUOTE HE CRIED CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AS DELIGHTED AS A CHILD WITH A NEW TOY </s>
<s> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT </s>
<s> IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY DELICATE TEST I REMARKED </s>
<s> BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL </s>
<s> THE OLD GUAIACUM TEST WAS VERY CLUMSY AND UNCERTAIN </s>
<s> SO IS THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION FOR BLOOD CORPUSCLES </s>
<s> THE LATTER IS VALUELESS IF THE STAINS ARE A FEW HOURS OLD </s>
<s> NOW THIS APPEARS TO ACT AS WELL WHETHER THE BLOOD IS OLD OR NEW </s>
<s> HAD THIS TEST BEEN INVENTED THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MEN NOW WALKING THE EARTH WHO WOULD LONG AGO HAVE PAID THE PENALTY OF THEIR CRIMES </s>
<s> INDEED </s>
<s> I MURMURED </s>
<s> QUOTE CRIMINAL CASES ARE CONTINUALLY HINGING UPON THAT ONE POINT </s>
<s> A MAN IS SUSPECTED OF A CRIME MONTHS PERHAPS AFTER IT HAS BEEN COMMITTED </s>
<s> HIS LINEN OR CLOTHES ARE EXAMINED AND BROWNISH STAINS DISCOVERED UPON THEM </s>
<s> ARE THEY BLOOD STAINS OR MUD STAINS OR RUST STAINS OR FRUIT STAINS OR WHAT ARE THEY </s>
<s> THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS PUZZLED MANY AN EXPERT AND WHY </s>
<s> BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RELIABLE TEST </s>
<s> NOW WE HAVE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES'S TEST AND THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY DIFFICULTY </s>
<s> HIS EYES FAIRLY GLITTERED AS HE SPOKE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART AND BOWED AS IF TO SOME APPLAUDING CROWD CONJURED UP BY HLS IMAGINATION </s>
<s> YOU ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED I REMARKED CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED AT HIS ENTHUSIASM </s>
<s> THERE WAS THE CASE OF VON BISCHOFF AT FRANKFORT LAST YEAR </s>
<s> HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HUNG HAD THIS TEST BEEN IN EXISTENCE </s>
<s> THEN THERE WAS MASON OF BRADFORD AND THE NOTORIOUS MULLER AND LEFEVRE OF MONTPELLIER AND SAMSON OF NEW ORLEANS </s>
<s> I COULD NAME A SCORE OF CASES IN WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DECISIVE </s>
<s> YOU SEEM TO BE A WALKING CALENDAR OF CRIME SAID STAMFORD WITH A LAUGH </s>
<s> QUOTE YOU MIGHT START A PAPER ON THOSE LINES </s>
<s> CALL IT THE POLICE NEWS OF THE PAST </s>
<s> VERY INTERESTING READING IT MIGHT BE MADE TOO REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES STICKING A SMALL PIECE OF PLASTER OVER THE PRICK ON HIS FINGER </s>
<s> I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HE CONTINUED TURNING TO ME WITH A SMILE FOR I DABBLE WITH POISONS A GOOD DEAL </s>
<s> HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE AND I NOTICED THAT IT WAS ALL MOTTLED OVER WITH SIMILAR PIECES OF PLASTER AND DISCOLOURED WITH STRONG ACIDS </s>
<s> WE CAME HERE ON BUSINESS SAID STAMFORD SITTING DOWN ON A HIGH THREE LEGGED STOOL AND PUSHING ANOTHER ONE IN MY DIRECTION WITH HIS FOOT </s>
<s> MY FRIEND HERE WANTS TO TAKE DIGGINGS AND AS YOU WERE COMPLAINING THAT YOU COULD GET NO ONE TO GO HALVES WITH YOU I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BETTER BRING YOU TOGETHER </s>
<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF SHARING HIS ROOMS WITH ME </s>
<s> QUOTE I HAVE MY EYE ON A SUITE IN BAKER STREET QUOTE HE SAID QUOTE WHICH WOULD SUIT US DOWN TO THE GROUND </s>
<s> YOU DON'T MIND THE SMELL OF STRONG TOBACCO I HOPE </s>
<s> I ALWAYS SMOKE SHIP'S' MYSELF I ANSWERED </s>
<s> THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH </s>
<s> I GENERALLY HAVE CHEMICALS ABOUT AND OCCASIONALLY DO EXPERIMENTS </s>
<s> WOULD THAT ANNOY YOU </s>
<s> BY NO MEANS </s>
<s> QUOTE LET ME SEE WHAT ARE MY OTHER SHORTCOMINGS </s>
<s> I GET IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES AND DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END </s>
<s> YOU MUST NOT THINK I AM SULKY WHEN I DO THAT </s>
<s> JUST LET ME ALONE AND I'LL SOON BE RIGHT </s>
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONFESS NOW </s>
<s> IT'S JUST AS WELL FOR TWO FELLOWS TO KNOW THE WORST OF ONE ANOTHER BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO LIVE TOGETHER </s>
<s> I LAUGHED AT THIS CROSS EXAMINATION </s>
<s> I KEEP A BULL PUP I SAID AND I OBJECT TO ROWS BECAUSE MY NERVES ARE SHAKEN AND I GET UP AT ALL SORTS OF UNGODLY HOURS AND I AM EXTREMELY LAZY </s>
<s> I HAVE ANOTHER SET OF VICES WHEN I'M WELL BUT THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL ONES AT PRESENT </s>
<s> DO YOU INCLUDE VIOLIN PLAYING IN YOUR CATEGORY OF ROWS HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY </s>
<s> IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAYER I ANSWERED </s>
<s> QUOTE A WELL PLAYED VIOLIN IS A TREAT FOR THE GODS A BADLY PLAYED ONE QUOTE </s>
<s> OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT HE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH </s>
<s> I THINK WE MAY CONSIDER THE THING AS SETTLED THAT IS IF THE ROOMS ARE AGREEABLE TO YOU </s>
<s> WHEN SHALL WE SEE THEM </s>
<s> CALL FOR ME HERE AT NOON TO MORROW AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER AND SETTLE EVERYTHING HE ANSWERED </s>
<s> ALL RIGHT NOON EXACTLY SAID I SHAKING HIS HAND </s>
<s> WE LEFT HIM WORKING AMONG HIS CHEMICALS AND WE WALKED TOGETHER TOWARDS MY HOTEL </s>
<s> QUOTE BY THE WAY QUOTE I ASKED SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TURNING UPON STAMFORD QUOTE HOW THE DEUCE DID HE KNOW THAT I HAD COME FROM AFGHANISTAN QUOTE </s>
<s> MY COMPANION SMILED AN ENIGMATICAL SMILE </s>
<s> THAT'S JUST HIS LITTLE PECULIARITY HE SAID </s>
<s> A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE FINDS THINGS OUT </s>
<s> OH A MYSTERY IS IT </s>
<s> I CRIED RUBBING MY HANDS </s>
<s> THIS IS VERY PIQUANT </s>
<s> I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER </s>
<s> THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN YOU KNOW </s>

<s> YOU'LL FIND HIM A KNOTTY PROBLEM THOUGH </s>
<s> I'LL WAGER HE LEARNS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU ABOUT HIM </s>
<s> GOOD BYE </s>
<s> GOOD BYE I ANSWERED AND STROLLED ON TO MY HOTEL CONSIDERABLY INTERESTED IN MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE </s>
<s> CHAPTER TWO THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION </s>
<s> WE MET NEXT DAY AS HE HAD ARRANGED AND INSPECTED THE ROOMS AT NUMBER TWENTY TWO L. B. BAKER STREET OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN AT OUR MEETING </s>
<s> THEY CONSISTED OF A COUPLE OF COMFORTABLE BEDROOMS AND A SINGLE LARGE AIRY SITTING ROOM CHEERFULLY FURNISHED AND ILLUMINATED BY TWO BROAD WINDOWS </s>
<s> SO DESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY WERE THE APARTMENTS AND SO MODERATE DID THE TERMS SEEM WHEN DIVIDED BETWEEN US THAT THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED UPON THE SPOT AND WE AT ONCE ENTERED INTO POSSESSION </s>
<s> THAT VERY EVENING I MOVED MY THINGS ROUND FROM THE HOTEL AND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHERLOCK HOLMES FOLLOWED ME WITH SEVERAL BOXES AND PORTMANTEAUS </s>
<s> FOR A DAY OR TWO WE WERE BUSILY EMPLOYED IN UNPACKING AND LAYING OUT OUR PROPERTY TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE </s>
<s> THAT DONE WE GRADUALLY BEGAN TO SETTLE DOWN AND TO ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO OUR NEW SURROUNDINGS </s>
<s> HOLMES WAS CERTAINLY NOT A DIFFICULT MAN TO LIVE WITH </s>
<s> HE WAS QUIET IN HIS WAYS AND HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR </s>
<s> IT WAS RARE FOR HIM TO BE UP AFTER TEN AT NIGHT AND HE HAD INVARIABLY BREAKFASTED AND GONE OUT BEFORE I ROSE IN THE MORNING </s>
<s> SOMETIMES HE SPENT HIS DAY AT THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY SOMETIMES IN THE DISSECTINGROOMS AND OCCASIONALLY IN LONG WALKS WHICH APPEARED TO TAKE HIM INTO THE LOWEST PORTIONS OF THE CITY </s>
<s> NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS ENERGY WHEN THE WORKING FIT WAS UPON HIM BUT NOW AND AGAIN A REACTION WOULD SEIZE HIM AND FOR DAYS ON END HE WOULD LIE UPON THE SOFA IN THE SITTING ROOM HARDLY UTTERING A WORD OR MOVING A MUSCLE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT </s>
<s> ON THESE OCCASIONS I HAVE NOTICED SUCH A DREAMY VACANT EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES THAT I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING ADDICTED TO THE USE OF SOME NARCOTIC HAD NOT THE TEMPERANCE AND CLEANLINESS OF HIS WHOLE LIFE FORBIDDEN SUCH A NOTION </s>
<s> AS THE WEEKS WENT BY MY INTEREST IN HIM AND MY CURIOSITY AS TO HIS AIMS IN LIFE GRADUALLY DEEPENED AND INCREASED </s>
<s> HIS VERY PERSON AND APPEARANCE WERE SUCH AS TO STRIKE THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER </s>
<s> IN HEIGHT HE WAS RATHER OVER SIX FEET AND SO EXCESSIVELY LEAN THAT HE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERABLY TALLER </s>
<s> HIS EYES WERE SHARP AND PIERCING SAVE DURING THOSE INTERVALS OF TORPOR TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED AND HIS THIN HAWK LIKE NOSE GAVE HIS WHOLE EXPRESSION AN AIR OF ALERTNESS AND DECISION </s>
<s> HIS CHIN TOO HAD THE PROMINENCE AND SQUARENESS WHICH MARK THE MAN OF DETERMINATION </s>
<s> HIS HANDS WERE INVARIABLY BLOTTED WITH INK AND STAINED WITH CHEMICALS YET HE WAS POSSESSED OF EXTRAORDINARY DELICACY OF TOUCH AS I FREQUENTLY HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE WHEN I WATCHED HIM MANIPULATING HIS FRAGILE PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS </s>
<s> THE READER MAY SET ME DOWN AS A HOPELESS BUSYBODY WHEN I CONFESS HOW MUCH THIS MAN STIMULATED MY CURIOSITY AND HOW OFTEN I ENDEAVOURED TO BREAK THROUGH THE RETICENCE WHICH HE SHOWED ON ALL THAT CONCERNED HIMSELF </s>
<s> BEFORE PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT HOWEVER BE IT REMEMBERED HOW OBJECTLESS WAS MY LIFE AND HOW LITTLE THERE WAS TO ENGAGE MY ATTENTION </s>
<s> MY HEALTH FORBADE ME FROM VENTURING OUT UNLESS THE WEATHER WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GENIAL AND I HAD NO FRIENDS WHO WOULD CALL UPON ME AND BREAK THE MONOTONY OF MY DAILY EXISTENCE </s>
<s> UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I EAGERLY HAILED THE LITTLE MYSTERY WHICH HUNG AROUND MY COMPANION AND SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNRAVEL IT </s>
<s> HE WAS NOT STUDYING MEDICINE </s>
<s> HE HAD HIMSELF IN REPLY TO A QUESTION CONFIRMED STAMFORD'S OPINION UPON THAT POINT </s>
<s> NEITHER DID HE APPEAR TO HAVE PURSUED ANY COURSE OF READING WHICH MIGHT FIT HIM FOR A DEGREE IN SCIENCE OR ANY OTHER RECOGNIZED PORTAL WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM AN ENTRANCE INTO THE LEARNED WORLD </s>
<s> YET HIS ZEAL FOR CERTAIN STUDIES WAS REMARKABLE AND WITHIN ECCENTRIC LIMITS HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO EXTRAORDINARILY AMPLE AND MINUTE THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS HAVE FAIRLY ASTOUNDED ME </s>
<s> SURELY NO MAN WOULD WORK SO HARD OR ATTAIN SUCH PRECISE INFORMATION UNLESS HE HAD SOME DEFINITE END IN VIEW </s>
<s> DESULTORY READERS ARE SELDOM REMARKABLE FOR THE EXACTNESS OF THEIR LEARNING </s>
<s> NO MAN BURDENS HIS MIND WITH SMALL MATTERS UNLESS HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO </s>
<s> HIS IGNORANCE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HIS KNOWLEDGE </s>
<s> OF CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS HE APPEARED TO KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING </s>
<s> UPON MY QUOTING THOMAS CARLYLE HE INQUIRED IN THE NAIVEST WAY WHO HE MIGHT BE AND WHAT HE HAD DONE </s>
<s> MY SURPRISE REACHED A CLIMAX HOWEVER WHEN I FOUND INCIDENTALLY THAT HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY AND OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM </s>
<s> THAT ANY CIVILIZED HUMAN BEING IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY SHOULD NOT BE AWARE THAT THE EARTH TRAVELLED ROUND THE SUN APPEARED TO ME TO BE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT THAT I COULD HARDLY REALIZE IT </s>
<s> YOU APPEAR TO BE ASTONISHED HE SAID SMILING AT MY EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE </s>
<s> NOW THAT I DO KNOW IT I SHALL DO MY BEST TO FORGET IT </s>
<s> QUOTE TO FORGET IT QUOTE </s>
<s> YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED I CONSIDER THAT A MAN'S BRAIN ORIGINALLY IS LIKE A LITTLE EMPTY ATTIC AND YOU HAVE TO STOCK IT WITH SUCH FURNITURE AS YOU CHOOSE </s>
<s> A FOOL TAKES IN ALL THE LUMBER OF EVERY SORT THAT HE COMES ACROSS SO THAT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HIM GETS CROWDED OUT OR AT BEST IS JUMBLED UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER THINGS SO THAT HE HAS A DIFFICULTY IN LAYING HIS HANDS UPON IT </s>
<s> NOW THE SKILFUL WORKMAN IS VERY CAREFUL INDEED AS TO WHAT HE TAKES INTO HIS BRAIN ATTIC </s>
<s> HE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT THE TOOLS WHICH MAY HELP HIM IN DOING HIS WORK BUT OF THESE HE HAS A LARGE ASSORTMENT AND ALL IN THE MOST PERFECT ORDER </s>
<s> IT IS A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THAT LITTLE ROOM HAS ELASTIC WALLS AND CAN DISTEND TO ANY EXTENT </s>
<s> DEPEND UPON IT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN FOR EVERY ADDITION OF KNOWLEDGE YOU FORGET SOMETHING THAT YOU KNEW BEFORE </s>
<s> IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE THEREFORE NOT TO HAVE USELESS FACTS ELBOWING OUT THE USEFUL ONES </s>
<s> BUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM </s>
<s> I PROTESTED </s>
<s> WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY YOU SAY THAT WE GO ROUND THE SUN </s>
<s> IF WE WENT ROUND THE MOON IT WOULD NOT MAKE A PENNYWORTH OF DIFFERENCE TO ME OR TO MY WORK </s>
<s> I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING HIM WHAT THAT WORK MIGHT BE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER SHOWED ME THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE AN UNWELCOME ONE </s>
<s> I PONDERED OVER OUR SHORT CONVERSATION HOWEVER AND ENDEAVOURED TO DRAW MY DEDUCTIONS FROM IT </s>
<s> HE SAID THAT HE WOULD ACQUIRE NO KNOWLEDGE WHICH DID NOT BEAR UPON HIS OBJECT </s>
<s> THEREFORE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE POSSESSED WAS SUCH AS WOULD BE USEFUL TO HIM </s>
<s> I ENUMERATED IN MY OWN MIND ALL THE VARIOUS POINTS UPON WHICH HE HAD SHOWN ME THAT HE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL INFORMED </s>
<s> I EVEN TOOK A PENCIL AND JOTTED THEM DOWN </s>
<s> I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE DOCUMENT WHEN I HAD COMPLETED IT </s>

<s> WHEN I HAD GOT SO FAR IN MY LIST I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE IN DESPAIR </s>
<s> IF I CAN ONLY FIND WHAT THE FELLOW IS DRIVING AT BY RECONCILING ALL THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DISCOVERING A CALLING WHICH NEEDS THEM ALL I SAID TO MYSELF I MAY AS WELL GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT AT ONCE </s>
<s> I SEE THAT I HAVE ALLUDED ABOVE TO HIS POWERS UPON THE VIOLIN </s>
<s> THESE WERE VERY REMARKABLE BUT AS ECCENTRIC AS ALL HIS OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS </s>
<s> THAT HE COULD PLAY PIECES AND DIFFICULT PIECES I KNEW WELL BECAUSE AT MY REQUEST HE HAS PLAYED ME SOME OF MENDELSSOHN'S LIEDER AND OTHER FAVOURITES </s>
<s> WHEN LEFT TO HIMSELF HOWEVER HE WOULD SELDOM PRODUCE ANY MUSIC OR ATTEMPT ANY RECOGNIZED AIR </s>
<s> LEANING BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR OF AN EVENING HE WOULD CLOSE HIS EYES AND SCRAPE CARELESSLY AT THE FIDDLE WHICH WAS THROWN ACROSS HIS KNEE </s>
<s> SOMETIMES THE CHORDS WERE SONOROUS AND MELANCHOLY </s>
<s> OCCASIONALLY THEY WERE FANTASTIC AND CHEERFUL </s>
<s> CLEARLY THEY REFLECTED THE THOUGHTS WHICH POSSESSED HIM BUT WHETHER THE MUSIC AIDED THOSE THOUGHTS OR WHETHER THE PLAYING WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A WHIM OR FANCY WAS MORE THAN I COULD DETERMINE </s>
<s> I MIGHT HAVE REBELLED AGAINST THESE EXASPERATING SOLOS HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HE USUALLY TERMINATED THEM BY PLAYING IN QUICK SUCCESSION A WHOLE SERIES OF MY FAVOURITE AIRS AS A SLIGHT COMPENSATION FOR THE TRIAL UPON MY PATIENCE </s>
<s> DURING THE FIRST WEEK OR SO WE HAD NO CALLERS AND I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT MY COMPANION WAS AS FRIENDLESS A MAN AS I WAS MYSELF </s>
<s> PRESENTLY HOWEVER I FOUND THAT HE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCES AND THOSE IN THE MOST DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY </s>
<s> THERE WAS ONE LITTLE SALLOW RAT FACED DARK EYED FELLOW WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MR. LESTRADE AND WHO CAME THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN A SINGLE WEEK </s>
<s> ONE MORNING A YOUNG GIRL CALLED FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND STAYED FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE </s>
<s> THE SAME AFTERNOON BROUGHT A GRAY HEADED SEEDY VISITOR LOOKING LIKE A JEW PEDDLER WHO APPEARED TO ME TO BE MUCH EXCITED AND WHO WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A SLIPSHOD ELDERLY WOMAN </s>
<s> ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN OLD WHITE HAIRED GENTLEMAN HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MY COMPANION AND ON ANOTHER A RAILWAY PORTER IN HIS VELVETEEN UNIFORM </s>
<s> WHEN ANY OF THESE NONDESCRIPT INDIVIDUALS PUT IN AN APPEARANCE SHERLOCK HOLMES USED TO BEG FOR THE USE OF THE SITTING ROOM AND I WOULD RETIRE TO MY BEDROOM </s>
<s> HE ALWAYS APOLOGIZED TO ME FOR PUTTING ME TO THIS INCONVENIENCE </s>
<s> I HAVE TO USE THIS ROOM AS A PLACE OF BUSINESS HE SAID AND THESE PEOPLE ARE MY CLIENTS </s>
<s> AGAIN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING HIM A POINT BLANK QUESTION AND AGAIN MY DELICACY PREVENTED ME FROM FORCING ANOTHER MAN TO CONFIDE IN ME </s>
<s> I IMAGINED AT THE TIME THAT HE HAD SOME STRONG REASON FOR NOT ALLUDING TO IT BUT HE SOON DISPELLED THE IDEA BY COMING ROUND TO THE SUBJECT OF HIS OWN ACCORD </s>
<s> IT WAS UPON THE FOURTH OF MARCH AS I HAVE GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER THAT I ROSE SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND FOUND THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD NOT YET FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST </s>
<s> THE LANDLADY HAD BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO MY LATE HABITS THAT MY PLACE HAD NOT BEEN LAID NOR MY COFFEE PREPARED </s>
<s> WITH THE UNREASONABLE PETULANCE OF MANKIND I RANG THE BELL AND GAVE A CURT INTIMATION THAT I WAS READY </s>
<s> THEN I PICKED UP A MAGAZINE FROM THE TABLE AND ATTEMPTED TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME WITH IT WHILE MY COMPANION MUNCHED SILENTLY AT HIS TOAST </s>
<s> ONE OF THE ARTICLES HAD A PENCIL MARK AT THE HEADING AND I NATURALLY BEGAN TO RUN MY EYE THROUGH IT </s>
<s> ITS SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS TITLE WAS THE BOOK OF LIFE AND IT ATTEMPTED TO SHOW HOW MUCH AN OBSERVANT MAN MIGHT LEARN BY AN ACCURATE AND SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF ALL THAT CAME IN HIS WAY </s>
<s> IT STRUCK ME AS BEING A REMARKABLE MIXTURE OF SHREWDNESS AND OF ABSURDITY </s>
<s> THE REASONING WAS CLOSE AND INTENSE BUT THE DEDUCTIONS APPEARED TO ME TO BE FAR FETCHED AND EXAGGERATED </s>
<s> THE WRITER CLAIMED BY A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION A TWITCH OF A MUSCLE OR A GLANCE OF AN EYE TO FATHOM A MAN'S INMOST THOUGHTS </s>
<s> DECEIT ACCORDING TO HIM WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE CASE OF ONE TRAINED TO OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS </s>
<s> HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE AS INFALLIBLE AS SO MANY PROPOSITIONS OF EUCLID </s>
<s> SO STARTLING WOULD HIS RESULTS APPEAR TO THE UNINITIATED THAT UNTIL THEY LEARNED THE PROCESSES BY WHICH HE HAD ARRIVED AT THEM THEY MIGHT WELL CONSIDER HIM AS A NECROMANCER </s>
<s> FROM A DROP OF WATER SAID THE WRITER A LOGICIAN COULD INFER THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ATLANTIC OR A NIAGARA WITHOUT HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE OR THE OTHER </s>
<s> SO ALL LIFE IS A GREAT CHAIN THE NATURE OF WHICH IS KNOWN WHENEVER WE ARE SHOWN A SINGLE LINK OF IT </s>

<s> FINALLY HE EXAMINED WITH HIS GLASS THE WORD UPON THE WALL GOING OVER EVERY LETTER OF IT WITH THE MOST MINUTE EXACTNESS </s>
<s> THIS DONE HE APPEARED TO BE SATISFIED FOR HE REPLACED HIS TAPE AND HIS GLASS IN HIS POCKET </s>
<s> THEY SAY THAT GENIUS IS AN INFINITE CAPACITY FOR TAKING PAINS HE REMARKED WITH A SMILE </s>
<s> QUOTE IT'S A VERY BAD DEFINITION BUT IT DOES APPLY TO DETECTIVE WORK QUOTE </s>
<s> GREGSON AND LESTRADE HAD WATCHED THE MANOEUVRES OF THEIR AMATEUR COMPANION WITH CONSIDERABLE CURIOSITY AND SOME CONTEMPT </s>

<s> THERE WAS A WORLD OF SARCASM IN HIS VOICE AS HE SPOKE </s>
<s> IF YOU WILL LET ME KNOW HOW YOUR INVESTIGATIONS GO HE CONTINUED I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ANY HELP I CAN </s>
<s> IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE CONSTABLE WHO FOUND THE BODY </s>
<s> CAN YOU GIVE ME HIS NAME AND ADDRESS </s>
<s> LESTRADE GLANCED AT HIS NOTEBOOK </s>
<s> QUOTE JOHN RANCE QUOTE HE SAID </s>
<s> HE IS OFF DUTY NOW </s>
<s> YOU WILL FIND HIM AT FORTY SIX AUDLEY COURT KENNINGTON PARK GATE </s>
<s> HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF THE ADDRESS </s>
<s> COME ALONG DOCTOR HE SAID WE SHALL GO AND LOOK HIM UP </s>
<s> I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING WHICH MAY HELP YOU IN THE CASE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO THE TWO DETECTIVES </s>
<s> THERE HAS BEEN MURDER DONE AND THE MURDERER WAS A MAN </s>
<s> HE WAS MORE THAN SIX FEET HIGH WAS IN THE PRIME OF LIFE HAD SMALL FEET FOR HIS HEIGHT WORE COARSE SQUARE TOED BOOTS AND SMOKED A TRICHINOPOLY CIGAR </s>
<s> HE CAME HERE WITH HIS VICTIM IN A FOUR WHEELED CAB WHICH WAS DRAWN BY A HORSE WITH THREE OLD SHOES AND ONE NEW ONE ON HIS OFF FORE LEG </s>
<s> IN ALL PROBABILITY THE MURDERER HAD A FLORID FACE AND THE FINGER NAILS OF HIS RIGHT HAND WERE REMARKABLY LONG </s>
<s> THESE ARE ONLY A FEW INDICATIONS BUT THEY MAY ASSIST YOU QUOTE </s>
<s> LESTRADE AND GREGSON GLANCED AT EACH OTHER WITH AN INCREDULOUS SMILE </s>
<s> IF THIS MAN WAS MURDERED HOW WAS IT DONE ASKED THE FORMER </s>
<s> POISON SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES CURTLY AND STRODE OFF </s>
<s> ONE OTHER THING LESTRADE HE ADDED TURNING ROUND AT THE DOOR RACHE IS THE GERMAN FOR REVENGE SO DON'T LOSE YOUR TIME LOOKING FOR MISS RACHEL </s>
<s> WITH WHICH PARTHIAN SHOT HE WALKED AWAY LEAVING THE TWO RIVALS OPEN MOUTHED BEHIND HIM </s>
<s> CHAPTER FOUR WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL </s>
<s> IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK WHEN WE LEFT NUMBER THREE LAURISTON GARDENS </s>
<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES LED ME TO THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE WHENCE HE DISPATCHED A LONG TELEGRAM </s>
<s> HE THEN HAILED A CAB AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO TAKE US TO THE ADDRESS GIVEN US BY LESTRADE </s>
<s> THERE IS NOTHING LIKE FIRST HAND EVIDENCE HE REMARKED AS A MATTER OF FACT MY MIND IS ENTIRELY MADE UP UPON THE CASE BUT STILL WE MAY AS WELL LEARN ALL THAT IS TO BE LEARNED </s>
<s> YOU AMAZE ME HOLMES SAID I. SURELY YOU ARE NOT AS SURE AS YOU PRETEND TO BE OF ALL THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH YOU GAVE </s>
<s> QUOTE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A MISTAKE QUOTE HE ANSWERED </s>
<s> THE VERY FIRST THING WHICH I OBSERVED ON ARRIVING THERE WAS THAT A CAB HAD MADE TWO RUTS WITH ITS WHEELS CLOSE TO THE CURB </s>
<s> NOW UP TO LAST NIGHT WE HAVE HAD NO RAIN FOR A WEEK SO THAT THOSE WHEELS WHICH LEFT SUCH A DEEP IMPRESSION MUST HAVE BEEN THERE DURING THE NIGHT </s>
<s> THERE WERE THE MARKS OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS TOO THE OUTLINE OF ONE OF WHICH WAS FAR MORE CLEARLY CUT THAN THAT OF THE OTHER THREE SHOWING THAT THAT WAS A NEW SHOE </s>
<s> SINCE THE CAB WAS THERE AFTER THE RAIN BEGAN AND WAS NOT THERE AT ANY TIME DURING THE MORNING I HAVE GREGSON'S WORD FOR THAT IT FOLLOWS THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE DURING THE NIGHT AND THEREFORE THAT IT BROUGHT THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS TO THE HOUSE </s>
<s> THAT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH SAID I BUT HOW ABOUT THE OTHER MAN'S HEIGHT </s>
<s> WHY THE HEIGHT OF A MAN IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN CAN BE TOLD FROM THE LENGTH OF HIS STRIDE </s>
<s> IT IS A SIMPLE CALCULATION ENOUGH THOUGH THERE IS NO USE MY BORING YOU WITH FIGURES </s>
<s> I HAD THIS FELLOW'S STRIDE BOTH ON THE CLAY OUTSIDE AND ON THE DUST WITHIN </s>
<s> THEN I HAD A WAY OF CHECKING MY CALCULATION </s>
<s> WHEN A MAN WRITES ON A WALL HIS INSTINCT LEADS HIM TO WRITE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HIS OWN EYES </s>
<s> NOW THAT WRITING WAS JUST OVER SIX FEET FROM THE GROUND </s>
<s> IT WAS CHILD'S PLAY </s>
<s> QUOTE AND HIS AGE QUOTE </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> WELL IF A MAN CAN STRIDE FOUR AND A HALF FEET WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EFFORT HE CAN'T BE QUITE IN THE SERE AND YELLOW </s>
<s> THAT WAS THE BREADTH OF A PUDDLE ON THE GARDEN WALK WHICH HE HAD EVIDENTLY WALKED ACROSS </s>
<s> PATENT LEATHER BOOTS HAD GONE ROUND AND SQUARE TOES HAD HOPPED OVER </s>
<s> THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT AT ALL </s>
<s> I AM SIMPLY APPLYING TO ORDINARY LIFE A FEW OF THOSE PRECEPTS OF OBSERVATION AND DEDUCTION WHICH I ADVOCATED IN THAT ARTICLE </s>
<s> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT PUZZLES YOU </s>
<s> THE FINGER NAILS AND THE TRICHINOPOLY I SUGGESTED </s>
<s> THE WRITING ON THE WALL WAS DONE WITH A MAN'S FOREFINGER DIPPED IN BLOOD </s>
<s> MY GLASS ALLOWED ME TO OBSERVE THAT THE PLASTER WAS SLIGHTLY SCRATCHED IN DOING IT WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE IF THE MAN'S NAIL HAD BEEN TRIMMED </s>
<s> I GATHERED UP SOME SCATTERED ASH FROM THE FLOOR </s>
<s> IT WAS DARK IN COLOUR AND FLAKY SUCH AN ASH IS ONLY MADE BY A TRICHINOPOLY </s>
<s> I HAVE MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF CIGAR ASHES IN FACT I HAVE WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE SUBJECT </s>
<s> I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I CAN DISTINGUISH AT A GLANCE THE ASH OF ANY KNOWN BRAND EITHER OF CIGAR OR OF TOBACCO </s>
<s> IT IS JUST IN SUCH DETAILS THAT THE SKILLED DETECTIVE DIFFERS FROM THE GREGSON AND LESTRADE TYPE </s>
<s> QUOTE AND THE FLORID FACE QUOTE </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> AH THAT WAS A MORE DARING SHOT THOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I WAS RIGHT </s>
<s> YOU MUST NOT ASK ME THAT AT THE PRESENT STATE OF THE AFFAIR </s>
<s> I PASSED MY HAND OVER MY BROW </s>
<s> MY HEAD IS IN A WHIRL I REMARKED THE MORE ONE THINKS OF IT THE MORE MYSTERIOUS IT GROWS </s>
<s> HOW CAME THESE TWO MEN IF THERE WERE TWO MEN INTO AN EMPTY HOUSE </s>
<s> WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE CABMAN WHO DROVE THEM </s>
<s> HOW COULD ONE MAN COMPEL ANOTHER TO TAKE POISON </s>
<s> WHERE DID THE BLOOD COME FROM </s>
<s> WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF THE MURDERER SINCE ROBBERY HAD NO PART IN IT </s>
<s> HOW CAME THE WOMAN'S RING THERE </s>
<s> ABOVE ALL WHY SHOULD THE SECOND MAN WRITE UP THE GERMAN WORD RACHE BEFORE DECAMPING </s>
<s> I CONFESS THAT I CANNOT SEE ANY POSSIBLE WAY OF RECONCILING ALL THESE FACTS </s>
<s> MY COMPANION SMILED APPROVINGLY </s>
<s> YOU SUM UP THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SITUATION SUCCINCTLY AND WELL HE SAID </s>
<s> QUOTE THERE IS MUCH THAT IS STILL OBSCURE THOUGH I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND ON THE MAIN FACTS </s>
<s> AS TO POOR LESTRADE'S DISCOVERY IT WAS SIMPLY A BLIND INTENDED TO PUT THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK BY SUGGESTING SOCIALISM AND SECRET SOCIETIES </s>
<s> IT WAS NOT DONE BY A GERMAN </s>
<s> THE A IF YOU NOTICED WAS PRINTED SOMEWHAT AFTER THE GERMAN FASHION </s>
<s> NOW A REAL GERMAN INVARIABLY PRINTS IN THE LATIN CHARACTER SO THAT WE MAY SAFELY SAY THAT THIS WAS NOT WRITTEN BY ONE BUT BY A CLUMSY IMITATOR WHO OVERDID HIS PART </s>
<s> IT WAS SIMPLY A RUSE TO DIVERT INQUIRY INTO A WRONG CHANNEL </s>
<s> I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU MUCH MORE OF THE CASE DOCTOR </s>
<s> YOU KNOW A CONJURER GETS NO CREDIT WHEN ONCE HE HAS EXPLAINED HIS TRICK AND IF I SHOW YOU TOO MUCH OF MY METHOD OF WORKING YOU WILL COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I AM A VERY ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL AFTER ALL </s>
<s> I SHALL NEVER DO THAT I ANSWERED YOU HAVE BROUGHT DETECTION AS NEAR AN EXACT SCIENCE AS IT EVER WILL BE BROUGHT IN THIS WORLD </s>
<s> MY COMPANION FLUSHED UP WITH PLEASURE AT MY WORDS AND THE EARNEST WAY IN WHICH I UTTERED THEM </s>
<s> I HAD ALREADY OBSERVED THAT HE WAS AS SENSITIVE TO FLATTERY ON THE SCORE OF HIS ART AS ANY GIRL COULD BE OF HER BEAUTY </s>
<s> I'LL TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING HE SAID </s>
<s> PATENT LEATHERS AND SQUARE TOES CAME IN THE SAME CAB AND THEY WALKED DOWN THE PATHWAY TOGETHER AS FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE ARM IN ARM IN ALL PROBABILITY </s>
<s> WHEN THEY GOT INSIDE THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM OR RATHER PATENT LEATHERS STOOD STILL WHILE SQUARE TOES WALKED UP AND DOWN </s>
<s> I COULD READ ALL THAT IN THE DUST AND I COULD READ THAT AS HE WALKED HE GREW MORE AND MORE EXCITED </s>
<s> THAT IS SHOWN BY THE INCREASED LENGTH OF HIS STRIDES </s>
<s> HE WAS TALKING ALL THE WHILE AND WORKING HIMSELF UP NO DOUBT INTO A FURY </s>
<s> THEN THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED </s>
<s> I'VE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW MYSELF NOW FOR THE REST IS MERE SURMISE AND CONJECTURE </s>
<s> WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING BASIS HOWEVER ON WHICH TO START </s>
<s> WE MUST HURRY UP FOR I WANT TO GO TO HALLE'S CONCERT TO HEAR NORMAN NERUDA THIS AFTERNOON </s>
<s> THIS CONVERSATION HAD OCCURRED WHILE OUR CAB HAD BEEN THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH A LONG SUCCESSION OF DINGY STREETS AND DREARY BYWAYS LN THE DINGIEST AND DREARIEST OF THEM OUR DRIVER SUDDENLY CAME TO A STAND </s>
<s> QUOTE THAT'S AUDLEY COURT IN THERE QUOTE HE SAID POINTING TO A NARROW SLIT IN THE LINE OF DEAD COLOURED BRICK </s>
<s> YOU'LL FIND ME HERE WHEN YOU COME BACK </s>
<s> AUDLEY COURT WAS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE LOCALITY </s>
<s> THE NARROW PASSAGE LED US INTO A QUADRANGLE PAVED WITH FLAGS AND LINED BY SORDID DWELLINGS </s>
<s> WE PICKED OUR WAY AMONG GROUPS OF DIRTY CHILDREN AND THROUGH LINES OF DISCOLOURED LINEN UNTIL WE CAME TO NUMBER FORTY SIX THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS DECORATED WITH A SMALL SLIP OF BRASS ON WHICH THE NAME RANCE WAS ENGRAVED </s>
<s> ON INQUIRY WE FOUND THAT THE CONSTABLE WAS IN BED AND WE WERE SHOWN INTO A LITTLE FRONT PARLOUR TO AWAIT HIS COMING </s>
<s> HE APPEARED PRESENTLY LOOKING A LITTLE IRRITABLE AT BEING DISTURBED IN HIS SLUMBERS </s>
<s> I MADE MY REPORT AT THE OFFICE HE SAID </s>

<s> I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO TELL YOU ANYTHING I CAN THE CONSTABLE ANSWERED WITH HIS EYES UPON THE LITTLE GOLDEN DISC </s>
<s> JUST LET US HEAR IT ALL IN YOUR OWN WAY AS IT OCCURRED </s>
<s> RANCE SAT DOWN ON THE HORSEHAIR SOFA AND KNITTED HIS BROWS AS THOUGH DETERMINED NOT TO OMIT ANYTHING IN HIS NARRATIVE </s>
<s> QUOTE I'LL TELL IT YE FROM THE BEGINNING QUOTE HE SAID </s>
<s> MY TIME IS FROM TEN AT NIGHT TO SIX IN THE MORNING </s>
<s> AT ELEVEN THERE WAS A FIGHT AT THE WHITE HART BUT BAR THAT ALL WAS QUIET ENOUGH ON THE BEAT </s>
<s> AT ONE O'CLOCK IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND I MET HARRY MURCHER HIM WHO HAS THE HOLLAND GROVE BEAT AND WE STOOD TOGETHER AT THE CORNER OF HENRIETTA STREET A TALKIN' </s>
<s> PRESENTLY MAYBE ABOUT TWO OR A LITTLE AFTER I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A LOOK ROUND AND SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT DOWN THE BRIXTON ROAD </s>
<s> IT WAS PRECIOUS DIRTY AND LONELY </s>
<s> NOT A SOUL DID I MEET ALL THE WAY DOWN THOUGH A CAB OR TWO WENT PAST ME </s>
<s> I WAS A STROLLIN' DOWN THINKIN' BETWEEN OURSELVES HOW UNCOMMON HANDY A FOUR OF GIN HOT WOULD BE WHEN SUDDENLY THE GLINT OF A LIGHT CAUGHT MY EYE IN THE WINDOW OF THAT SAME HOUSE </s>

<s> WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR </s>
<s> YOU STOPPED AND THEN WALKED BACK TO THE GARDEN GATE MY COMPANION INTERRUPTED </s>
<s> WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR </s>
<s> RANCE GAVE A VIOLENT JUMP AND STARED AT SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT UPON HIS FEATURES </s>
<s> WHY THAT'S TRUE SIR HE SAID THOUGH HOW YOU COME TO KNOW IT HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS </s>
<s> YE SEE WHEN I GOT UP TO THE DOOR IT WAS SO STILL AND SO LONESOME THAT I THOUGHT I'D BE NONE THE WORSE FOR SOMEONE WITH ME </s>
<s> I AIN'T AFEARED OF ANYTHING ON THIS SIDE O' THE GRAVE BUT I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT WAS HIM THAT DIED O' THE TYPHOID INSPECTING THE DRAINS WHAT KILLED HIM </s>

<s> I REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD SNIFFED HIS LIPS AND HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD DETECTED SOMETHING WHICH HAD GIVEN RISE TO THE IDEA </s>
<s> THEN AGAIN IF NOT POISON WHAT HAD CAUSED THE MAN'S DEATH SINCE THERE WAS NEITHER WOUND NOR MARKS OF STRANGULATION </s>
<s> BUT ON THE OTNER HAND WHOSE BLOOD WAS THAT WHICH LAY SO THICKLY UPON THE FLOOR </s>
<s> THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE NOR HAD THE VICTIM ANY WEAPON WITH WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED AN ANTAGONIST </s>
<s> AS LONG AS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WERE UNSOLVED I FELT THAT SLEEP WOULD BE NO EASY MATTER EITHER FOR HOLMES OR MYSELF </s>

<s> ON BEING ASKED WHERE THIS OLD SHIPMATE LIVED HE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY SATISFACTORY REPLY </s>
<s> I THINK THE WHOLE CASE FITS TOGETHER UNCOMMONLY WELL </s>
<s> WHAT AMUSES ME IS TO THINK OF LESTRADE WHO HAD STARTED OFF UPON THE WRONG SCENT </s>
<s> I AM AFRAID HE WON'T MAKE MUCH OF IT </s>
<s> WHY BY JOVE HERE'S THE VERY MAN HIMSELF </s>
<s> IT WAS INDEED LESTRADE WHO HAD ASCENDED THE STAIRS WHILE WE WERE TALKING AND WHO NOW ENTERED THE ROOM </s>

<s> HAVE YOU MANAGED TO FIND THE SECRETARY MR. JOSEPH STANGERSON </s>
<s> THE SECRETARY MR. JOSEPH STANGERSON SAID LESTRADE GRAVELY WAS MURDERED AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING </s>
<s> CHAPTER SEVEN LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS </s>

<s> QUOTE THE PLOT THICKENS QUOTE </s>
<s> IT WAS QUITE THICK ENOUGH BEFORE GRUMBLED LESTRADE TAKING A CHAIR I SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF COUNCIL OF WAR </s>
<s> ARE YOU ARE YOU SURE OF THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE STAMMERED GREGSON </s>

<s> I WAS THE FIRST TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD OCCURRED </s>
<s> WE HAVE BEEN HEARING GREGSON'S VIEW OF THE MATTER HOLMES OBSERVED </s>
<s> QUOTE WOULD YOU MIND LETTING US KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE QUOTE </s>
<s> I HAVE NO OBJECTION LESTRADE ANSWERED SEATING HIMSELF </s>
<s> I FREELY CONFESS THAT I WAS OF THE OPINION THAT STANGERSON WAS CONCERNED IN THE DEATH OF DREBBER </s>
<s> THIS FRESH DEVELOPMENT HAS SHOWN ME THAT I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN </s>
<s> FULL OF THE ONE IDEA I SET MYSELF TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE SECRETARY </s>
<s> THEY HAD BEEN SEEN TOGETHER AT EUSTON STATION ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD </s>
<s> AT TWO IN THE MORNING DREBBER HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE BRIXTON ROAD </s>
<s> THE QUESTION WHICH CONFRONTED ME WAS TO FIND OUT HOW STANGERSON HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BETWEEN EIGHT THIRTY AND THE TIME OF THE CRIME AND WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM AFTERWARDS </s>
<s> I TELEGRAPHED TO LIVERPOOL GIVING A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN AND WARNING THEM TO KEEP A WATCH UPON THE AMERICAN BOATS </s>
<s> I THEN SET TO WORK CALLING UPON ALL THE HOTELS AND LODGINGHOUSES IN THE VICINITY OF EUSTON </s>
<s> YOU SEE I ARGUED THAT IF DREBBER AND HIS COMPANION HAD BECOME SEPARATED THE NATURAL COURSE FOR THE LATTER WOULD BE TO PUT UP SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN TO HANG ABOUT THE STATION AGAIN NEXT MORNING </s>
<s> THEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO AGREE ON SOME MEETING PLACE BEFOREHAND REMARKED HOLMES </s>
<s> SO IT PROVED </s>
<s> I SPENT THE WHOLE OF YESTERDAY EVENING IN MAKING INQUIRIES ENTIRELY WITHOUT AVAIL </s>

<s> ON MY INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER A MR. STANGERSON WAS LIVING THERE THEY AT ONCE ANSWERED ME IN THE AFFIRMATIVE </s>

<s> WHERE IS HE NOW </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> HE IS UPSTAIRS IN BED </s>
<s> HE WISHED TO BE CALLED AT NINE </s>
<s> I WILL GO UP AND SEE HIM AT ONCE I SAID </s>

<s> THE BOOTS VOLUNTEERED TO SHOW ME THE ROOM IT WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR LEADING UP TO IT </s>
<s> THE BOOTS POINTED OUT THE DOOR TO ME AND WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN WHEN I SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE ME FEEL SICKISH IN SPITE OF MY TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE </s>
<s> FROM UNDER THE DOOR THERE CURLED A LITTLE RED RIBBON OF BLOOD WHICH HAD MEANDERED ACROSS THE PASSAGE AND FORMED A LITTLE POOL ALONG THE SKIRTING AT THE OTHER SIDE </s>
<s> I GAVE A CRY WHICH BROUGHT THE BOOTS BACK </s>
<s> HE NEARLY FAINTED WHEN HE SAW IT </s>
<s> THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE BUT WE PUT OUR SHOULDERS TO IT AND KNOCKED IT IN </s>
<s> THE WINDOW OF THE ROOM WAS OPEN AND BESIDE THE WINDOW ALL HUDDLED UP LAY THE BODY OF A MAN IN HIS NIGHTDRESS </s>
<s> HE WAS QUITE DEAD AND HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME FOR HIS LIMBS WERE RIGID AND COLD </s>
<s> WHEN WE TURNED HIM OVER THE BOOTS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AS BEING THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ENGAGED THE ROOM UNDER THE NAME OF JOSEPH STANGERSON </s>

<s> WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WAS ABOVE THE MURDERED MAN </s>
<s> I FELT A CREEPING OF THE FLESH AND A PRESENTIMENT OF COMING HORROR EVEN BEFORE SHEROCK HOLMES ANSWERED </s>
<s> QUOTE THAT WAS IT QUOTE SAID LESTRADE IN AN AWESTRUCK VOICE AND WE WERE ALL SILENT FOR A WHILE </s>
<s> THERE WAS SOMETHING SO METHODICAL AND SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE ABOUT THE DEEDS OF THIS UNKNOWN ASSASSIN THAT IT IMPARTED A FRESH GHASTLINESS TO HIS CRIMES </s>
<s> MY NERVES WHICH WERE STEADY ENOUGH ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE TINGLED AS I THOUGHT OF IT </s>
<s> THE MAN WAS SEEN CONTINUED LESTRADE </s>

<s> IT WOULD BE QUITE AS DEADLY AND A GOOD DEAL LESS NOISY THAN FIRING ACROSS A HANDKERCHIEF </s>
<s> FROM THAT DAY I HAD ALWAYS MY PILL BOXES ABOUT WITH ME. AND THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN I WAS TO USE THEM </s>
<s> IT WAS NEARER ONE THAN TWELVE AND A WILD BLEAK NIGHT BLOWING HARD AND RAINING IN TORRENTS </s>
<s> DISMAL AS IT WAS OUTSIDE </s>

<s> IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER PINED FOR A THING AND LONGED FOR IT DURING TWENTY LONG YEARS AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND IT WITHIN YOUR REACH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS </s>
<s> I LIT A CIGAR AND PUFFED AT IT TO STEADY MY NERVES BUT MY HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND MY TEMPLES THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT </s>

<s> I SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM IT'S TIME TO GET OUT </s>
<s> I SAID </s>
<s> ALL RIGHT CABBY SAID HE </s>
<s> I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT WE HAD COME TO THE HOTEL THAT HE HAD MENTIONED FOR HE GOT OUT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE GARDEN </s>
<s> I HAD TO WALK BESIDE HIM TO KEEP HIM STEADY FOR HE WAS STILL A LITTLE TOP HEAVY </s>

<s> I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME </s>

<s> I SAID I HAVE HUNTED YOU FROM SALT LAKE CITY TO SAINT PETERSBURG AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS ESCAPED ME </s>

<s> HE SHRUNK STILL FARTHER AWAY AS I SPOKE AND I COULD SEE ON HIS FACE THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD </s>
<s> SO I WAS FOR THE TIME </s>
<s> THE PULSES IN MY TEMPLES BEAT LIKE SLEDGEHAMMERS AND I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE HAD A FIT OF SOME SORT IF THE BLOOD HAD NOT GUSHED FROM MY NOSE AND RELIEVED ME </s>

<s> I CRIED LOCKING THE DOOR AND SHAKING THE KEY IN HIS FACE </s>
<s> PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING BUT IT HAS OVERTAKEN YOU AT LAST </s>

<s> HE WOULD HAVE BEGGED FOR HIS LIFE BUT HE KNEW WELL THAT IT WAS USELESS </s>
<s> WOULD YOU MURDER ME HE STAMMERED </s>
<s> QUOTE THERE IS NO MURDER I ANSWERED </s>

<s> HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME </s>
<s> THEN I SWALLOWED THE OTHER AND WE STOOD FACING ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR MORE WAITING TO SEE WHICH WAS TO LIVE AND WHICH WAS TO DIE </s>

<s> I LAUGHED AS I SAW IT AND HELD LUCY'S MARRIAGE RING IN FRONT OF HIS EYES </s>
<s> IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ACTION OF THE ALKALOID IS RAPID </s>
<s> A SPASM OF PAIN CONTORTED HIS FEATURES HE THREW HIS HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM STAGGERED AND THEN WITH A HOARSE CRY FELL HEAVILY UPON THE FLOOR </s>
<s> I TURNED HIM OVER WITH MY FOOT AND PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HEART </s>
<s> THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT </s>
<s> HE WAS DEAD </s>
<s> THE BLOOD HAD BEEN STREAMING FROM MY NOSE BUT I HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF IT </s>
<s> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO WRITE UPON THE WALL WITH IT </s>
<s> PERHAPS IT WAS SOME MISCHIEVOUS IDEA OF SETTING THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK FOR I FELT LIGHTHEARTED AND CHEERFUL </s>
<s> I REMEMBER A GERMAN BEING FOUND IN NEW YORK WITH RACHE WRITTEN UP ABOVE HIM AND IT WAS ARGUED AT THE TIME IN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT THE SECRET SOCIETIES MUST HAVE DONE IT </s>
<s> I GUESSED THAT WHAT PUZZLED THE NEW YORKERS WOULD PUZZLE THE LONDONERS SO I DIPPED MY FINGER IN MY OWN BLOOD AND PRINTED IT ON A CONVENIENT PLACE ON THE WALL </s>
<s> THEN I WALKED DOWN TO MY CAB AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ABOUT AND THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL VERY WILD </s>
<s> I HAD DRIVEN SOME DISTANCE WHEN I PUT MY HAND INTO THE POCKET IN WHICH I USUALLY KEPT LUCY'S RING AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT THERE </s>
<s> I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AT THIS FOR IT WAS THE ONLY MEMENTO THAT I HAD OF HER </s>
<s> THINKING THAT I MIGHT HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN I STOOPED OVER DREBBER'S BODY I DROVE BACK AND LEAVING MY CAB IN A SIDE STREET I WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE HOUSE FOR I WAS READY TO DARE ANYTHING RATHER THAN LOSE THE RING </s>
<s> WHEN I ARRIVED THERE I WALKED RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF A POLICEOFFICER WHO WAS COMING OUT AND ONLY MANAGED TO DISARM HIS SUSPICIONS BY PRETENDING TO BE HOPELESSLY DRUNK </s>
<s> THAT WAS HOW ENOCH DREBBER CAME TO HIS END </s>
<s> ALL I HAD TO DO THEN WAS TO DO AS MUCH FOR STANGERSON AND SO PAY OFF JOHN FERRIER'S DEBT </s>

<s> HE WAS CUNNING WAS STANGERSON AND ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD </s>
<s> IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD KEEP ME OFF BY STAYING INDOORS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN </s>
<s> I SOON FOUND OUT WHICH WAS THE WINDOW OF HIS BEDROOM AND EARLY NEXT MORNING I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME LADDERS WHICH WERE LYING IN THE LANE BEHIND THE HOTEL AND SO MADE MY WAY INTO HIS ROOM IN THE GRAY OF THE DAWN </s>
<s> I WOKE HIM UP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WAS TO ANSWER FOR THE LIFE HE HAD TAKEN SO LONG BEFORE </s>
<s> I DESCRIBED DREBBER'S DEATH TO HIM AND I GAVE HIM THE SAME CHOICE OF THE POISONED PILLS </s>
<s> INSTEAD OF GRASPING AT THE CHANCE OF SAFETY WHICH THAT OFFERED HIM HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED AND FLEW AT MY THROAT </s>
<s> IN SELF DEFENCE I STABBED HIM TO THE HEART </s>
<s> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME IN ANY CASE FOR PROVIDENCE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED HIS GUILTY HAND TO PICK OUT ANYTHING BUT THE POISON </s>
<s> QUOTE I HAVE LITTLE MORE TO SAY AND IT'S AS WELL FOR I AM ABOUT DONE UP </s>
<s> I WENT ON CABBING IT FOR A DAY OR SO INTENDING TO KEEP AT IT UNTIL I COULD SAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE ME BACK TO AMERICA </s>
<s> I WAS STANDING IN THE YARD WHEN A RAGGED YOUNGSTER ASKED IF THERE WAS A CABBY THERE CALLED JEFFERSON HOPE AND SAID THAT HIS CAB WAS WANTED BY A GENTLEMAN AT TWENTY TWO L. B. BAKER STREET </s>
<s> I WENT ROUND SUSPECTING NO HARM AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW THIS YOUNG MAN HERE HAD THE BRACELETS ON MY WRISTS AND AS NEATLY SHACKLED AS EVER I SAW IN MY LIFE </s>
<s> THAT'S THE WHOLE OF MY STORY GENTLEMEN </s>
<s> YOU MAY CONSIDER ME TO BE A MURDERER BUT I HOLD THAT I AM JUST AS MUCH AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE AS YOU ARE </s>

<s> MY FRIEND VOLUNTEERED TO GO AND SEE </s>
<s> I THINK YOU'LL OWN HE DID IT SMARTLY </s>

<s> NOW GENTLEMEN THE INSPECTOR REMARKED GRAVELY THE FORMS OF THE LAW MUST BE COMPLIED WITH </s>
<s> ON THURSDAY THE PRISONER WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES AND YOUR ATTENDANCE WILL BE REQUIRED </s>
<s> UNTIL THEN I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM </s>

<s> CHAPTER SEVEN THE CONCLUSION </s>
<s> WE HAD ALL BEEN WARNED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES UPON THE THURSDAY BUT WHEN THE THURSDAY CAME THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR OUR TESTIMONY </s>
<s> A HIGHER JUDGE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER IN HAND AND JEFFERSON HOPE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A TRIBUNAL WHERE STRICT JUSTICE WOULD BE METED OUT TO HIM </s>
<s> ON THE VERY NIGHT AFTER HIS CAPTURE THE ANEURISM BURST AND HE WAS FOUND IN THE MORNING STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CELL WITH A PLACID SMILE UPON HIS FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN ABLE IN HIS DYING MOMENTS TO LOOK BACK UPON A USEFUL LIFE AND ON WORK WELL DONE </s>
<s> GREGSON AND LESTRADE WILL BE WILD ABOUT HIS DEATH HOLMES REMARKED AS WE CHATTED IT OVER NEXT EVENING </s>
<s> WHERE WILL THEIR GRAND ADVERTISEMENT BE NOW </s>
<s> I DON'T SEE THAT THEY HAD VERY MUCH TO DO WITH HIS CAPTURE I ANSWERED </s>
<s> QUOTE WHAT YOU DO IN THIS WORLD IS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE QUOTE RETURNED MY COMPANION BITTERLY </s>
<s> THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN YOU MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE DONE </s>
<s> NEVER MIND HE CONTINUED MORE BRIGHTLY AFTER A PAUSE </s>
<s> I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THE INVESTIGATION FOR ANYTHING </s>
<s> THERE HAS BEEN NO BETTER CASE WITHIN MY RECOLLECTION </s>
<s> SIMPLE AS IT WAS THERE WERE SEVERAL MOST INSTRUCTIVE POINTS ABOUT IT </s>
<s> SIMPLE </s>
<s> I EJACULATED </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL REALLY IT CAN HARDLY BE DESCRIBED AS OTHERWISE QUOTE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES SMILING AT MY SURPRISE </s>
<s> THE PROOF OF ITS INTRINSIC SIMPLICITY IS THAT WITHOUT ANY HELP SAVE A FEW VERY ORDINARY DEDUCTIONS I WAS ABLE TO LAY MY HAND UPON THE CRIMINAL WITHIN THREE DAYS </s>
<s> THAT IS TRUE SAID I </s>
<s> I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT WHAT IS OUT OF THE COMMON IS USUALLY A GUIDE RATHER THAN A HINDRANCE </s>
<s> IN SOLVING A PROBLEM OF THIS SORT THE GRAND THING IS TO BE ABLE TO REASON BACKWARD </s>
<s> THAT IS A VERY USEFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A VERY EASY ONE BUT PEOPLE DO NOT PRACTISE IT MUCH </s>
<s> IN THE EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF LIFE IT IS MORE USEFUL TO REASON FORWARD AND SO THE OTHER COMES TO BE NEGLECTED </s>
<s> THERE ARE FIFTY WHO CAN REASON SYNTHETICALLY FOR ONE WHO CAN REASON ANALYTICALLY </s>
<s> I CONFESS SAID I THAT I DO NOT QUITE FOLLOW YOU </s>
<s> QUOTE I HARDLY EXPECTED THAT YOU WOULD </s>
<s> LET ME SEE IF I CAN MAKE IT CLEARER </s>
<s> MOST PEOPLE IF YOU DESCRIBE A TRAIN OF EVENTS TO THEM WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE </s>
<s> THEY CAN PUT THOSE EVENTS TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AND ARGUE FROM THEM THAT SOMETHING WILL COME TO PASS </s>
<s> THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE HOWEVER WHO IF YOU TOLD THEM A RESULT WOULD BE ABLE TO EVOLVE FROM THEIR OWN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT THE STEPS WERE WHICH LED UP TO THAT RESULT </s>
<s> THIS POWER IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I TALK OF REASONING BACKWARD OR ANALYTICALLY </s>
<s> I UNDERSTAND SAID I </s>
<s> NOW THIS WAS A CASE IN WHICH YOU WERE GIVEN THE RESULT AND HAD TO FIND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR YOURSELF </s>
<s> NOW LET ME ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENT STEPS IN MY REASONING </s>
<s> TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING </s>
<s> I APPROACHED THE HOUSE AS YOU KNOW ON FOOT AND WITH MY MIND ENTIRELY FREE FROM ALL IMPRESSIONS </s>
<s> I NATURALLY BEGAN BY EXAMINING THE ROADWAY AND THERE AS I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU I SAW CLEARLY THE MARKS OF A CAB WHICH I ASCERTAINED BY INQUIRY MUST HAVE BEEN THERE DURING THE NIGHT </s>
<s> I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT WAS A CAB AND NOT A PRIVATE CARRIAGE BY THE NARROW GAUGE OF THE WHEELS </s>
<s> THE ORDINARY LONDON GROWLER IS CONSIDERABLY LESS WIDE THAN A GENTLEMAN'S BROUGHAM </s>
<s> THIS WAS THE FIRST POINT GAINED </s>
<s> I THEN WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE GARDEN PATH WHICH HAPPENED TO BE COMPOSED OF A CLAY SOIL PECULIARLY SUITABLE FOR TAKING IMPRESSIONS </s>
<s> NO DOUBT IT APPEARED TO YOU TO BE A MERE TRAMPLED LINE OF SLUSH BUT TO MY TRAINED EYES EVERY MARK UPON ITS SURFACE HAD A MEANING </s>
<s> THERE IS NO BRANCH OF DETECTIVE SCIENCE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO MUCH NEGLECTED AS THE ART OF TRACING FOOTSTEPS </s>
<s> HAPPILY I HAVE ALWAYS LAID GREAT STRESS UPON IT AND MUCH PRACTICE HAS MADE IT SECOND NATURE TO ME </s>
<s> I SAW THE HEAVY FOOTMARKS OF THE CONSTABLES BUT I SAW ALSO THE TRACK OF THE TWO MEN WHO HAD FIRST PASSED THROUGH THE GARDEN </s>
<s> IT WAS EASY TO TELL THAT THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE THE OTHERS BECAUSE IN PLACES THEIR MARKS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OBLITERATED BY THE OTHERS COMING UPON THE TOP OF THEM </s>
<s> IN THIS WAY MY SECOND LINK WAS FORMED WHICH TOLD ME THAT THE NOCTURNAL VISITORS WERE TWO IN NUMBER ONE REMARKABLE FOR HIS HEIGHT AS I CALCULATED FROM THE LENGTH OF HIS STRIDE AND THE OTHER FASHIONABLY DRESSED TO JUDGE FROM THE SMALL AND ELEGANT IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS BOOTS </s>
<s> ON ENTERING THE HOUSE THIS LAST INFERENCE WAS CONFIRMED </s>
<s> MY WELL BOOTED MAN LAY BEFORE ME </s>
<s> THE TALL ONE THEN HAD DONE THE MURDER IF MURDER THERE WAS </s>
<s> THERE WAS NO WOUND UPON THE DEAD MAN'S PERSON BUT THE AGITATED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD FORESEEN HIS FATE BEFORE IT CAME UPON HIM </s>
<s> MEN WHO DIE FROM HEART DISEASE OR ANY SUDDEN NATURAL CAUSE NEVER BY ANY CHANCE EXHIBIT AGITATION UPON THEIR FEATURES </s>
<s> HAVING SNIFFED THE DEAD MAN'S LIPS I DETECTED A SLIGHTLY SOUR SMELL AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD HAD POISON FORCED UPON HIM </s>
<s> AGAIN I ARGUED THAT IT HAD BEEN FORCED UPON HIM FROM THE HATRED AND FEAR EXPRESSED UPON HIS FACE </s>
<s> BY THE METHOD OF EXCLUSION I HAD ARRIVED AT THIS RESULT FOR NO OTHER HYPOTHESIS WOULD MEET THE FACTS </s>
<s> DO NOT IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A VERY UNHEARD OF IDEA </s>
<s> THE FORCIBLE ADMINISTRATION OF POISON IS BY NO MEANS A NEW THING IN CRIMINAL ANNALS </s>
<s> THE CASES OF DOLSKY IN ODESSA AND OF LETURIER IN MONTPELLIER WILL OCCUR AT ONCE TO ANY TOXICOLOGIST </s>
<s> QUOTE AND NOW CAME THE GREAT QUESTION AS TO THE REASON WHY </s>
<s> ROBBERY HAD NOT BEEN THE OBJECT OF THE MURDER FOR NOTHING WAS TAKEN </s>
<s> WAS IT POLITICS THEN OR WAS IT A WOMAN </s>
<s> THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH CONFRONTED ME </s>
<s> I WAS INCLINED FROM THE FIRST TO THE LATTER SUPPOSITION </s>
<s> POLITICAL ASSASSINS ARE ONLY TOO GLAD TO DO THEIR WORK AND TO FLY </s>
<s> THIS MURDER HAD ON THE CONTRARY BEEN DONE MOST DELIBERATELY AND THE PERPETRATOR HAD LEFT HIS TRACKS ALL OVER THE ROOM SHOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME </s>
<s> IT MUST HAVE BEEN A PRIVATE WRONG AND NOT A POLITICAL ONE WHICH CALLED FOR SUCH A METHODICAL REVENGE </s>
<s> WHEN THE INSCRIPTION WAS DISCOVERED UPON THE WALL I WAS MORE INCLINED THAN EVER TO MY OPINION </s>
<s> THE THING WAS TOO EVIDENTLY A BLIND </s>
<s> WHEN THE RING WAS FOUND HOWEVER IT SETTLED THE QUESTION </s>
<s> CLEARLY THE MURDERER HAD USED IT TO REMIND HIS VICTIM OF SOME DEAD OR ABSENT WOMAN </s>
<s> IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT I ASKED CREGSON WHETHER HE HAD INQUIRED IN HIS TELEGRAM TO CLEVELAND AS TO ANY PARTICULAR POINT IN MR. DREBBER'S FORMER CAREER </s>
<s> HE ANSWERED YOU REMEMBER IN THE NEGATIVE </s>
<s> I THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM WHICH CONFIRMED ME IN MY OPINION AS TO THE MURDERER'S HEIGHT AND FURNISHED ME WITH THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS TO THE TRICHINOPOLY CIGAR AND THE LENGTH OF HIS NAILS </s>
<s> I HAD ALREADY COME TO THE CONCLUSION SINCE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COVERED THE FLOOR HAD BURST FROM THE MURDERER'S NOSE IN HIS EXCITEMENT </s>
<s> I COULD PERCEIVE THAT THE TRACK OF BLOOD COINCIDED WITH THE TRACK OF HIS FEET </s>
<s> IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY MAN UNLESS HE IS VERY FULL BLOODED BREAKS OUT IN THIS WAY THROUGH EMOTION SO I HAZARDED THE OPINION THAT THE CRIMINAL WAS PROBABLY A ROBUST AND RUDDY FACED MAN </s>
<s> EVENTS PROVED THAT I HAD JUDGED CORRECTLY </s>
<s> HAVING LEFT THE HOUSE I PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT GREGSON HAD NEGLECTED </s>
<s> I TELEGRAPHED TO THE HEAD OF THE POLICE AT CLEVELAND LIMITING MY INQUIRY TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE MARRIAGE OF ENOCH DREBBER </s>
<s> THE ANSWER WAS CONCLUSIVE </s>
<s> IT TOLD ME THAT DREBBER HAD ALREADY APPLIED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW AGAINST AN OLD RIVAL IN LOVE NAMED JEFFERSON HOPE AND THAT THIS SAME HOPE WAS AT PRESENT IN EUROPE </s>
<s> I KNEW NOW THAT I HELD THE CLUE TO THE MYSTERY IN MY HAND AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO SECURE THE MURDERER </s>
<s> I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE MAN WHO HAD WALKED INTO THE HOUSE WITH DREBBER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE MAN WHO HAD DRIVEN THE CAB </s>
<s> THE MARKS IN THE ROAD SHOWED ME THAT THE HORSE HAD WANDERED ON IN A WAY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HAD THERE BEEN ANYONE IN CHARGE OF IT </s>
<s> WHERE THEN COULD THE DRIVER BE UNLESS HE WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE </s>
<s> AGAIN IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT ANY SANE MAN WOULD CARRY OUT A DELIBERATE CRIME UNDER THE VERY EYES AS IT WERE OF A THIRD PERSON WHO WAS SURE TO BETRAY HIM </s>
<s> LASTLY SUPPOSING ONE MAN WISHED TO DOG ANOTHER THROUGH LONDON WHAT BETTER MEANS COULD HE ADOPT THAN TO TURN CABDRIVER </s>
<s> ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS LED ME TO THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSION THAT JEFFERSON HOPE WAS TO BE FOUND AMONG THE JARVEYS OF THE METROPOLIS </s>
<s> IF HE HAD BEEN ONE THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD CEASED TO BE </s>
<s> ON THE CONTRARY FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW ANY SUDDEN CHANGE WOULD BE LIKELY TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF </s>
<s> HE WOULD PROBABLY FOR A TIME AT LEAST CONTINUE TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES </s>
<s> THERE'WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS GOING UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME </s>
<s> WHY SHOULD HE CHANGE HIS NAME IN A COUNTRY WHERE NO ONE KNEW HIS ORIGINAL ONE </s>
<s> I THEREFORE ORGANIZED MY STREET ARAB DETECTIVE CORPS AND SENT THEM SYSTEMATICALLY TO EVERY CAB PROPRIETOR IN LONDON UNTIL THEY FERRETED OUT THE MAN THAT I WANTED </s>
<s> HOW WELL THEY SUCCEEDED AND HOW QUICKLY I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT ARE STILL FRESH IN YOUR RECOLLECTION </s>
<s> THE MURDER OF STANGERSON WAS AN INCIDENT WHICH WAS ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED BUT WHICH COULD HARDLY IN ANY CASE HAVE BEEN PREVENTED </s>
<s> THROUGH IT AS YOU KNOW I CAME INTO POSSESSION OF THE PILLS THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH I HAD ALREADY SURMISED </s>
<s> YOU SEE THE WHOLE THING IS A CHAIN OF LOGICAL SEQUENCES WITHOUT A BREAK OR FLAW </s>
<s> QUOTE IT IS WONDERFUL QUOTE </s>
<s> I CRIED </s>
<s> YOUR MERITS SHOULD BE PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED </s>
<s> YOU SHOULD PUBLISH AN ACCOUNT OF THE CASE </s>
<s> IF YOU WON'T I WILL FOR YOU </s>
<s> YOU MAY DO WHAT YOU LIKE DOCTOR HE ANSWERED </s>
<s> SEE HERE HE CONTINUED HANDING A PAPER OVER TO ME LOOK AT THIS </s>
<s> IT WAS THE ECHO FOR THE DAY AND THE PARAGRAPH TO WHICH HE POINTED WAS DEVOTED TO THE CASE IN QUESTION </s>
<s> THE PUBLIC IT SAID HAVE LOST A SENSATIONAL TREAT THROUGH THE SUDDEN DEATH OF THE MAN HOPE WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF THE MURDER OF MR. ENOCH DREBBER AND OF MR. JOSEPH STANGERSON </s>
<s> THE DETAILS OF THE CASE WILL PROBABLY BE NEVER KNOWN NOW THOUGH WE ARE INFORMED UPON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE CRIME WAS THE RESULT OF AN OLD STANDING AND ROMANTIC FEUD IN WHICH LOVE AND MORMONISM BORE A PART </s>
<s> IT SEEMS THAT BOTH THE VICTIMS BELONGED IN THEIR YOUNGER DAYS TO THE LATTER DAY SAINTS AND HOPE THE DECEASED PRISONER HAILS ALSO FROM SALT LAKE CITY </s>
<s> IF THE CASE HAS HAD NO OTHER EFFECT IT AT LEAST BRINGS OUT IN THE MOST STRIKING MANNER THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR DETECTIVE POLICE FORCE AND WILL SERVE AS A LESSON TO ALL FOREIGNERS THAT THEY WILL DO WISELY TO SETTLE THEIR FEUDS AT HOME AND NOT TO CARRY THEM ON TO BRITISH SOIL </s>
<s> IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE CREDIT OF THIS SMART CAPTURE BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THE WELL KNOWN SCOTLAND YARD OFFICIALS MESSRS LESTRADE AND GREGSON </s>
<s> THE MAN WAS APPREHENDED IT APPEARS IN THE ROOMS OF A CERTAIN MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES WHO HAS HIMSELF AS AN AMATEUR SHOWN SOME TALENT IN THE DETECTIVE LINE AND WHO WITH SUCH INSTRUCTORS MAY HOPE IN TIME TO ATTAIN TO SOME DEGREE OF THEIR SKILL </s>
<s> IT IS EXPECTED THAT A TESTIMONIAL OF SOME SORT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE TWO OFFICERS AS A FITTING RECOGNITION OF THEIR SERVICES QUOTE </s>
<s> DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO WHEN WE STARTED CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH A LAUGH </s>
<s> THAT'S THE RESULT OF ALL OUR STUDY IN SCARLET TO GET THEM A TESTIMONIAL </s>
<s> NEVER MIND I ANSWERED I HAVE ALL THE FACTS IN MY JOURNAL AND THE PUBLIC SHALL KNOW THEM </s>
<s> IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF CONTENTED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUCCESS LIKE THE ROMAN MISER POPULUS ME SIBILAT AT MIHI PLAUDO IPSE DOMI SIMUL AC NUMMOS CONTEMPLAR IN ARCA </s>
