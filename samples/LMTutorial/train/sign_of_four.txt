<s> HONESTLY I CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU UPON IT </s>
<s> DETECTION IS OR OUGHT TO BE AN EXACT SCIENCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL MANNER </s>

<s> I WAS CONSULTED LAST WEEK BY FRANCOIS LE VILLARD WHO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW HAS COME RATHER TO THE FRONT LATELY IN THE FRENCH DETECTIVE SERVICE </s>

<s> HE TOSSED OVER AS HE SPOKE A CRUMPLED SHEET OF FOREIGN NOTEPAPER </s>
<s> I GLANCED MY EYES DOWN IT CATCHING A PROFUSION OF NOTES OF ADMIRATION WITH STRAY MAGNIFIQUES COUP DE MAITRES AND TOURS DE FORCE ALL TESTIFYING TO THE ARDENT ADMIRATION OF THE FRENCHMAN </s>
<s> HE SPEAKS AS A PUPIL TO HIS MASTER SAID I </s>
<s> OH HE RATES MY ASSISTANCE TOO HIGHLY SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES LIGHTLY </s>
<s> HE HAS COOSIDERABLE GIFTS HIMSELF </s>
<s> HE POSSESSES TWO OUT OF THE THREE QUALITIES NECESSARY FOR THE IDEAL DETECTIVE </s>
<s> HE HAS THE POWER OF OBSERVATION AND THAT OF DEDUCTION </s>
<s> HE IS ONLY WANTING IN KNOWLEDGE AND THAT MAY COME IN TIME </s>
<s> HE IS NOW TRANSLATING MY SMALL WORKS INTO FRENCH </s>
<s> YOUR WORKS </s>
<s> QUOTE OH DIDN'T YOU KNOW QUOTE HE CRIED LAUGHING </s>
<s> YES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SEVERAL MONOGRAPHS </s>
<s> THEY ARE ALL UPON TECHNICAL SUBJECTS </s>
<s> HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE UPON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ASHES OF THE VARIOUS TOBACCOS </s>
<s> IN IT I ENUMERATE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FORMS OF CIGAR CIGARETTE AND PIPE TOBACCO WITH COLOURED PLATES ILLUSTRATING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ASH </s>
<s> IT IS A POINT WHICH IS CONTINUALLY TURNING UP IN CRIMINAL TRIALS AND WHICH IS SOMETIMES OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE AS A CLUE </s>
<s> IF YOU CAN SAY DEFINITELY FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOME MURDER HAD BEEN DONE BY A MAN WHO WAS SMOKING AN INDIAN LUNKAH IT OBVIOUSLY NARROWS YOUR FIELD OF SEARCH </s>
<s> TO THE TRAINED EYE THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLACK ASH OF A TRICHINOPOLY AND THE WHITE FLUFF OF BIRD'S EYE AS THERE IS BETWEEN A CABBAGE AND A POTATO </s>
<s> YOU HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS FOR MINUTIAE I REMARKED </s>
<s> I APPRECIATE THEIR IMPORTANCE </s>
<s> HERE IS MY MONOGRAPH UPON THE TRACING OF FOOTSTEPS WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE USES OF PLASTER OF PARIS AS A PRESERVER OF IMPRESSES </s>
<s> HERE TOO IS A CURIOUS LITTLE WORK UPON THE INFLUENCE OF A TRADE UPON THE FORM OF THE HAND WITH LITHOTYPES OF THE HANDS OF SLATERS SAILORS CORKCUTTERS COMPOSITORS WEAVERS AND DIAMOND POLISHERS </s>
<s> THAT IS A MATTER OF GREAT PRACTICAL INTEREST TO THE SCIENTIFIC DETECTIVE ESPECIALLY IN CASES OF UNCLAIMED BODIES OR IN DISCOVERING THE ANTECEDENTS OF CRIMINALS </s>
<s> BUT I WEARY YOU WITH MY HOBBY </s>
<s> QUOTE NOT AT ALL QUOTE I ANSWERED EARNESTLY </s>
<s> IT IS OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO ME ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING YOUR PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF IT </s>
<s> BUT YOU SPOKE JUST NOW OF OBSERVATION AND DEDUCTION </s>
<s> SURELY THE ONE TO SOME EXTENT IMPLIES THE OTHER </s>
<s> WHY HARDLY HE ANSWERED LEANING BACK LUXURIOUSLY IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND SENDING UP THICK BLUE WREATHS FROM HIS PIPE </s>
<s> FOR EXAMPLE OBSERVATION SHOWS ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE WIGMORE STREET POST OFFICE THIS MORNING BUT DEDUCTION LETS ME KNOW THAT WHEN THERE YOU DISPATCHED A TELEGRAM </s>
<s> RIGHT SAID I. RIGHT ON BOTH POINTS </s>
<s> BUT I CONFESS THAT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU ARRIVED AT IT </s>
<s> IT WAS A SUDDEN IMPULSE UPON MY PART AND I HAVE MENTIONED IT TO NO ONE QUOTE </s>
<s> IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF HE REMARKED CHUCKLING AT MY SURPRISE SO ABSURDLY SIMPLE THAT AN EXPLANATION IS SUPERFLUOUS AND YET IT MAY SERVE TO DEFINE THE LIMITS OF OBSERVATION AND OF DEDUCTION </s>
<s> OBSERVATION TELLS ME THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE REDDISH MOULD ADHERING TO YOUR INSTEP </s>
<s> JUST OPPOSITE THE WIGMORE STREET OFFICE THEY HAVE TAKEN UP THE PAVEMENT AND THROWN UP SOME EARTH WHICH LIES IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO AVOID TREADING IN IT IN ENTERING </s>
<s> THE EARTH IS OF THIS PECULIAR REDDISH TINT WHICH IS FOUND AS FAR AS I KNOW NOWHERE ELSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD </s>
<s> SO MUCH IS OBSERVATION </s>
<s> THE REST IS DEDUCTION </s>
<s> HOW THEN DID YOU DEDUCE THE TELEGRAM </s>
<s> WHY OF COURSE I KNEW THAT YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN A LETTER SINCE I SAT OPPOSITE TO YOU ALL MORNING </s>
<s> I SEE ALSO IN YOUR OPEN DESK THERE THAT YOU HAVE A SHEET OF STAMPS AND A THICK BUNDLE OF POSTCARDS </s>
<s> WHAT COULD YOU GO INTO THE POST OFFICE FOR THEN BUT TO SEND A WIRE </s>
<s> ELIMINATE ALL OTHER FACTORS AND THE ONE WHICH REMAINS MUST BE THE TRUTH </s>
<s> QUOTE IN THIS CASE IT CERTAINLY IS SO QUOTE I REPLIED AFTER A LITTLE THOUGHT </s>
<s> THE THING HOWEVER IS AS YOU SAY OF THE SIMPLEST </s>
<s> WOULD YOU THINK ME IMPERTINENT IF I WERE TO PUT YOUR THEORIES TO A MORE SEVERE TEST </s>
<s> ON THE CONTRARY HE ANSWERED IT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM TAKING A SECOND DOSE OF COCAINE </s>
<s> I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO LOOK INTO ANY PROBLEM WHICH YOU MIGHT SUBMIT TO ME </s>
<s> I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A MAN TO HAVE ANY OBJECT IN DAILY USE WITHOUT LEAVING THE IMPRESS OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY UPON IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT A TRAINED OBSERVER MIGHT READ IT </s>
<s> NOW I HAVE HERE A WATCH WHICH HAS RECENTLY COME INTO MY POSSESSION </s>
<s> WOULD YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO LET ME HAVE AN OPINION UPON THE CHARACTER OR HABITS OF THE LATE OWNER QUOTE </s>
<s> I HANDED HIM OVER THE WATCH WITH SOME SLIGHT FEELING OF AMUSEMENT IN MY HEART FOR THE TEST WAS AS I THOUGHT AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE AND I INTENDED IT AS A LESSON AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT DOGMATIC TONE WHICH HE OCCASIONALLY ASSUMED </s>
<s> HE BALANCED THE WATCH IN HIS HAND GAZED HARD AT THE DIAL OPENED THE BACK AND EXAMINED THE WORKS FIRST WITH HIS NAKED EYES AND THEN WITH A POWERFUL CONVEX LENS </s>
<s> I COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM SMILING AT HIS CRESTFALLEN FACE WHEN HE FINALLY SNAPPED THE CASE TO AND HANDED IT BACK </s>
<s> THERE ARE HARDLY ANY DATA HE REMARKED </s>
<s> THE WATCH HAS BEEN RECENTLY CLEANED WHICH ROBS ME OF MY MOST SUGGESTIVE FACTS </s>
<s> YOU ARE RIGHT I ANSWERED </s>
<s> IT WAS CLEANED BEFORE BEING SENT TO ME </s>
<s> IN MY HEART I ACCUSED MY COMPANION OF PUTTING FORWARD A MOST LAME AND IMPOTENT EXCUSE TO COVER HIS FAILURE </s>
<s> WHAT DATA COULD HE EXPECT FROM AN UNCLEANED WATCH </s>
<s> THOUGH UNSATISFACTORY MY RESEARCH HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY BARREN HE OBSERVED STARING UP AT THE CEILING WITH DREAMY LACK LUSTRE EYES </s>
<s> QUOTE SUBJECT TO YOUR CORRECTION I SHOULD JUDGE THAT THE WATCH BELONGED TO YOUR ELDER BROTHER WHO INHERITED IT FROM YOUR FATHER QUOTE </s>
<s> THAT YOU GATHER NO DOUBT FROM THE H. W. UPON THE BACK </s>
<s> QUITE SO </s>
<s> THE W. SUGGESTS YOUR OWN NAME </s>
<s> THE DATE OF THE WATCH IS NEARLY FIFTY YEARS BACK AND THE INITIALS ARE AS OLD AS THE WATCH SO IT WAS MADE FOR THE LAST GENERATION </s>

<s> IT HAS THEREFORE BEEN IN THE HANDS OF YOUR ELDEST BROTHER </s>
<s> RIGHT SO FAR SAID I. ANYTHING ELSE </s>
<s> HE WAS A MAN OF UNTIDY HABITS VERY UNTIDY AND CARELESS </s>
<s> HE WAS LEFT WITH GOOD PROSPECTS BUT HE THREW AWAY HIS CHANCES LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN POVERTY WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT INTERVALS OF PROSPERITY AND FINALLY TAKING TO DRINK HE DIED </s>
<s> THAT IS ALL I CAN GATHER QUOTE </s>
<s> I SPRANG FROM MY CHAIR AND LIMPED IMPATIENTLY ABOUT THE ROOM WITH CONSIDERABLE BITTERNESS IN MY HEART </s>
<s> THIS IS UNWORTHY OF YOU HOLMES I SAID </s>
<s> I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DESCENDED TO THIS </s>
<s> YOU HAVE MADE INQUIRIES INTO THE HISTORY OF MY UNHAPPY BROTHER AND YOU NOW PRETEND TO DEDUCE THIS KNOWLEDGE IN SOME FANCIFUL WAY </s>
<s> YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE READ ALL THIS FROM HIS OLD WATCH </s>
<s> IT IS UNKIND AND TO SPEAK PLAINLY HAS A TOUCH OF CHARLATANISM IN IT </s>
<s> MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID HE KINDLY PRAY ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES </s>
<s> VIEWING THE MATTER AS AN ABSTRACT PROBLEM I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW PERSONAL AND PAINFUL A THING IT MIGHT BE TO YOU </s>
<s> I ASSURE YOU HOWEVER THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW THAT YOU HAD A BROTHER UNTIL YOU HANDED ME THE WATCH </s>
<s> QUOTE THEN HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL DID YOU GET THESE FACTS </s>
<s> THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN EVERY PARTICULAR </s>
<s> AH THAT IS GOOD LUCK </s>
<s> I COULD ONLY SAY WHAT WAS THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITY </s>
<s> I DID NOT AT ALL EXPECT TO BE SO ACCURATE </s>
<s> BUT IT WAS NOT MERE GUESSWORK </s>
<s> NO NO I NEVER GUESS </s>
<s> IT IS A SHOCKING HABIT DESTRUCTIVE TO THE LOGICAL FACULTY </s>
<s> WHAT SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU IS ONLY SO BECAUSE YOU DO NOT FOLLOW MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT OR OBSERVE THE SMALL FACTS UPON WHICH LARGE INFERENCES MAY DEPEND </s>
<s> FOR EXAMPLE I BEGAN BY STATING THAT YOUR BROTHER WAS CARELESS </s>
<s> WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE LOWER PART OF THAT WATCH CASE YOU NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT ONLY DINTED IN TWO PLACES BUT IT IS CUT AND MARKED ALL OVER FROM THE HABIT OF KEEPING OTHER HARD OBJECTS SUCH AS COINS OR KEYS IN THE SAME POCKET </s>
<s> SURELY IT IS NO GREAT FEAT TO ASSUME THAT A MAN WHO TREATS A FIFTY GUINEA WATCH SO CAVALIERLY MUST BE A CARELESS MAN </s>
<s> NEITHER IS IT A VERY FAR FETCHED INFERENCE THAT A MAN WHO INHERITS ONE ARTICLE OF SUCH VALUE IS PRETTY WELL PROVIDED FOR IN OTHER RESPECTS QUOTE </s>
<s> I NODDED TO SHOW THAT I FOLLOWED HIS REASONING </s>
<s> IT IS VERY CUSTOMARY FOR PAWNBROKERS IN ENGLAND WHEN THEY TAKE A WATCH TO SCRATCH THE NUMBERS OF THE TICKET WITH A PINPOINT UPON THE INSIDE OF THE CASE </s>
<s> IT IS MORE HANDY THAN A LABEL AS THERE IS NO RISK OF THE NUMBER BEING LOST OR TRANSPOSED </s>
<s> THERE ARE NO LESS THAN FOUR SUCH NUMBERS VISIBLE TO MY LENS ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CASE </s>
<s> INFERENCE THAT YOUR BROTHER WAS OFTEN AT LOW WATER </s>
<s> SECONDARY INFERENCE THAT HE HAD OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF PROSPERITY OR HE COULD NOT HAVE REDEEMED THE PLEDGE </s>

<s> WHAT COULD BE MORE HOPELESSLY PROSAIC AND MATERIAL </s>
<s> WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING POWERS DOCTOR WHEN ONE HAS NO FIELD UPON WHICH TO EXERT THEM </s>
<s> CRIME IS COMMONPLACC EXISTENCE IS COMMONPLACE AND NO QUALITIES SAVE THOSE WHICH ARE COMMONPLACE HAVE ANY FUNCTION UPON EARTH </s>
<s> I HAD OPENED MY MOUTH TO REPLY TO THIS TIRADE WHEN WITH A CRISP KNOCK OUR LANDLADY ENTERED BEARING A CARD UPON THE BRASS SALVER </s>
<s> A YOUNG LADY FOR YOU SIR SHE SAID ADDRESSING MY COMPANION </s>
<s> MISS MARY MORSTAN HE READ </s>
<s> HUM </s>
<s> I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THE NAME </s>
<s> ASK THE YOUNG LADY TO STEP UP MRS. HUDSON </s>
<s> DON'T GO DOCTOR </s>
<s> I SHOULD PREFER THAT YOU REMAIN </s>
<s> CHAPTER TWO THE STATEMENT OF THE CASE </s>
<s> MISS MORSTAN ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A FIRM STEP AND AN OUTWARD COMPOSURE OF MANNER </s>
<s> SHE WAS A BLONDE YOUNG LADY SMALL DAINTY WELL GLOVED AND DRESSED IN THE MOST PERFECT TASTE </s>
<s> THERE WAS HOWEVER A PLAINNESS AND SIMPLICITY ABOUT HER COSTUME WHICH BORE WITH IT A SUGGESTION OF LIMITED MEANS </s>
<s> THE DRESS WAS A SOMBRE GRAYISH BEIGE UNTRIMMED AND UNBRAIDED AND SHE WORE A SMALL TURBAN OF THE SAME DULL HUE RELIEVED ONLY BY A SUSPICION OF WHITE FEATHER IN THE SIDE </s>
<s> HER FACE HAD NEITHER REGULARITY OF FEATURE NOR BEAUTY OF COMPLEXION BUT HER EXPRESSION WAS SWEET AND AMIABLE AND HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE SINGULARLY SPIRITUAL AND SYMPATHETIC </s>
<s> IN AN EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN WHICH EXTENDS OVER MANY NATIONS AND THREE SEPARATE CONTINENTS I HAVE NEVER LOOKED UPON A FACE WHICH GAVE A CLEARER PROMISE OF A REFINED AND SENSITIVE NATURE </s>
<s> I COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT AS SHE TOOK THE SEAT WHICH SHERLOCK HOLMES PLACED FOR HER HER LIP TREMBLED HER HAND QUIVERED AND SHE SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF INTENSE INWARD AGITATION </s>
<s> QUOTE I HAVE COME TO YOU MR. HOLMES QUOTE SHE SAID QUOTE BECAUSE YOU ONCE ENABLED MY EMPLOYER MRS. CECIL FORRESTER TO UNRAVEL A LITTLE DOMESTIC COMPLICATION </s>
<s> SHE WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY YOUR KINDNESS AND SKILL </s>
<s> MRS. CECIL FORRESTER HE REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY </s>
<s> I BELIEVE THAT I WAS OF SOME SLIGHT SERVICE TO HER </s>
<s> THE CASE HOWEVER AS I REMEMBER IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE ONE </s>
<s> SHE DID NOT THINK SO </s>
<s> BUT AT LEAST YOU CANNOT SAY THE SAME OF MINE </s>
<s> I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE ANYTHING MORE STRANGE MORE UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE THAN THE SITUATION IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF QUOTE </s>
<s> HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS AND HIS EYES GLISTENED </s>
<s> HE LEANED FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR WITH AN EXPRESSION OF EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION UPON HIS CLEAR CUT HAWKLIKE FEATURES </s>
<s> STATE YOUR CASE SAID HE IN BRISK BUSINESS TONES </s>
<s> I FELT THAT MY POSITION WAS AN EMBARRASSING ONE </s>
<s> YOU WILL I AM SURE EXCUSE ME I SAID RISING FROM MY CHAIR </s>
<s> TO MY SURPRISE THE YOUNG LADY HELD UP HER GLOVED HAND TO DETAIN ME </s>
<s> IF YOUR FRIEND SHE SAID WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO STOP HE MIGHT BE OF INESTIMABLE SERVICE TO ME </s>
<s> I RELAPSED INTO MY CHAIR </s>
<s> BRIEFLY SHE CONTINUED THE FACTS ARE THESE </s>
<s> MY FATHER WAS AN OFFICER IN AN INDIAN REGIMENT WHO SENT ME HOME WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD </s>
<s> MY MOTHER WAS DEAD AND I HAD NO RELATIVE IN ENGLAND </s>
<s> I WAS PLACED HOWEVER IN A COMFORTABLE BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT AT EDINBURGH AND THERE I REMAINED UNTIL I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE </s>
<s> IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MY FATHER WHO WAS SENIOR CAPTAIN OF HIS REGIMENT OBTAINED TWELVE MONTHS' LEAVE AND CAME HOME </s>
<s> HE TELEGRAPHED TO ME FROM LONDON THAT HE HAD ARRIVED ALL SAFE AND DIRECTED ME TO COME DOWN AT ONCE GIVING THE LANGHAM HOTEL AS HIS ADDRESS </s>
<s> HIS MESSAGE AS I REMEMBER WAS FULL OF KINDNESS AND LOVE </s>
<s> ON REACHING LONDON I DROVE TO THE LANGHAM AND WAS INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN MORSTAN WAS STAYING THERE BUT THAT HE HAD GONE OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAD NOT RETURNED </s>
<s> I WAITED ALL DAY WITHOUT NEWS OF HIM </s>
<s> THAT NIGHT ON THE ADVICE OF THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL I COMMUNICATED WITH THE POLICE AND NEXT MORNING WE ADVERTISED IN ALL THE PAPERS </s>
<s> OUR INQUIRIES LED TO NO RESULT AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS NO WORD HAS EVER BEEN HEARD OF MY UNFORTUNATE FATHER </s>
<s> HE CAME HOME WITH HIS HEART FULL OF HOPE TO FIND SOME PEACE SOME COMFORT AND INSTEAD </s>
<s> SHE PUT HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND A CHOKING SOB CUT SHORT THE SENTENCE </s>
<s> QUOTE THE DATE QUOTE ASKED HOLMES OPENING HIS NOTEBOOK </s>
<s> HE DISAPPEARED UPON THE THIRD OF DECEMBER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO </s>
<s> HIS LUGGAGE </s>
<s> REMAINED AT THE HOTEL </s>
<s> THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO SUGGEST A CLUE SOME CLOTHES SOME BOOKS AND A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF CURIOSITIES FROM THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS </s>
<s> HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF THE CONVICT GUARD THERE </s>
<s> HAD HE ANY FRIENDS IN TOWN </s>
<s> QUOTE ONLY ONE THAT WE KNOW OF MAJOR SHOLTO OF HIS OWN REGIMENT THE THIRTY FOURTH BOMBAY INFANTRY </s>
<s> THE MAJOR HAD RETIRED SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE AND LIVED AT UPPER NORWOOD </s>
<s> WE COMMUNICATED WITH HIM OF COURSE BUT HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HIS BROTHER OFFICER WAS IN ENGLAND </s>
<s> A SINGULAR CASE REMARKED HOLMES </s>
<s> I HAVE NOT YET DESCRIBED TO YOU THE MOST SINGULAR PART </s>
<s> ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO TO BE EXACT UPON THE FOURTH OF MAY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO AN ADVERTISEMENT APPEARED IN THE TIMES ASKING FOR THE ADDRESS OF MISS MARY MORSTAN AND STATING THAT IT WOULD BE TO HER ADVANTAGE TO COME FORWARD </s>
<s> THERE WAS NO NAME OR ADDRESS APPENDED </s>
<s> I HAD AT THAT TIME JUST ENTERED THE FAMILY OF MRS. CECIL FORRESTER IN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNESS </s>
<s> BY HER ADVICE I PUBLISHED MY ADDRESS IN THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMN </s>
<s> THE SAME DAY THERE ARRIVED THROUGH THE POST A SMALL CARDBOARD BOX ADDRESSED TO ME WHICH I FOUND TO CONTAIN A VERY LARGE AND LUSTROUS PEARL </s>
<s> NO WORD OF WRITING WAS ENCLOSED </s>
<s> SINCE THEN EVERY YEAR UPON THE SAME DATE THERE HAS ALWAYS APPEARED A SIMILAR BOX CONTAINING A SIMILAR PEARL WITHOUT ANY CLUE AS TO THE SENDER </s>
<s> THEY HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED BY AN EXPERT TO BE OF A RARE VARIETY AND OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE </s>
<s> YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT THEY ARE VERY HANASOME </s>
<s> SHE OPENED A FLAT BOX AS SHE SPOKE AND SHOWED ME SIX OF THE FINEST PEARLS THAT I HAD EVER SEEN </s>
<s> YOUR STATEMENT IS MOST INTERESTING SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES </s>
<s> QUOTE HAS ANYTHING ELSE OCCURRED TO YOU QUOTE </s>

<s> MY FATHER WAS AS YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED MAJOR JOHN SHOLTO ONCE OF THE INDIAN ARMY </s>
<s> HE RETIRED SOME ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND CAME TO LIVE AT PONDICHERRY LODGE IN UPPER NORWOOD </s>
<s> HE HAD PROSPERED IN INDIA AND BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY A LARGE COLLECTION OF VALUABLE CURIOSITIES AND A STAFF OF NATIVE SERVANTS </s>
<s> WITH THESE ADVANTAGES HE BOUGHT HIMSELF A HOUSE AND LIVED IN GREAT LUXURY </s>
<s> MY TWINBROTHER BARTHOLOMEW AND I WERE THE ONLY CHILDREN </s>
<s> I VERY WELL REMEMBER THE SENSATION WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CAPTAIN MORSTAN </s>
<s> WE READ THE DETAILS IN THE PAPERS AND KNOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN A FRIEND OF OUR FATHER'S WE DISCUSSED THE CASE FREELY IN HIS PRESENCE </s>
<s> HE USED TO JOIN IN OUR SPECULATIONS AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED </s>
<s> NEVER FOR AN INSTANT DID WE SUSPECT THAT HE HAD THE WHOLE SECRET HIDDEN IN HIS OWN BREAST THAT OF ALL MEN HE ALONE KNEW THE FATE OF ARTHUR MORSTAN </s>
<s> WE DID KNOW HOWEVER THAT SOME MYSTERY SOME POSITIVE DANGER OVERHUNG OUR FATHER </s>
<s> HE WAS VERY FEARFUL OF GOING OUT ALONE AND HE ALWAYS EMPLOYED TWO PRIZE FIGHTERS TO ACT AS PORTERS AT PONDICHERRY LODGE </s>
<s> WILLIAMS WHO DROVE YOU TONIGHT WAS ONE OF THEM </s>
<s> HE WAS ONCE LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION OF ENGLAND </s>
<s> OUR FATHER WOULD NEVER TELL US WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED BUT HE HAD A MOST MARKED AVERSION TO MEN WITH WOODEN LEGS </s>
<s> ON ONE OCCASION HE ACTUALLY FIRED HIS REVOLVER AT A WOODEN LEGGED MAN WHO PROVED TO BE A HARMLESS TRADESMAN CANVASSING FOR ORDERS </s>
<s> WE HAD TO PAY A LARGE SUM TO HUSH THE MATTER UP </s>
<s> MY BROTHER AND I USED TO THINK THIS A MERE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S BUT EVENTS HAVE SINCE LED US TO CHANGE OUR OPINION </s>
<s> QUOTE EARLY IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MY FATHER RECEIVED A LETTER FROM INDIA WHICH WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO HIM </s>

<s> WHEN WE ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WAS PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS AND BREATHING HEAVILY </s>
<s> HE BESOUGHT US TO LOCK THE DOOR AND TO COME UPON EITHER SIDE OF THE BED </s>
<s> THEN GRASPING OUR HANDS HE MADE A REMARKABLE STATEMENT TO US IN A VOICE WHICH WAS BROKEN AS MUCH BY EMOTION AS BY PAIN </s>
<s> I SHALL TRY AND GIVE IT TO YOU IN HIS OWN VERY WORDS </s>
<s> I HAVE ONLY ONE THING HE SAID WHICH WEIGHS UPON MY MIND AT THIS SUPREME MOMENT </s>
<s> IT IS MY TREATMENT OF POOR MORSTAN'S ORPHAN </s>
<s> THE CURSED GREED WHICH HAS BEEN MY BESETTING SIN THROUGH LIFE HAS WITHHELD FROM HER THE TREASURE HALF AT LEAST OF WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERS </s>
<s> AND YET I HAVE MADE NO USE OF IT MYSELF SO BLIND AND FOOLISH A THING IS AVARICE </s>
<s> THE MERE FEELING OF POSSESSION HAS BEEN SO DEAR TO ME THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SHARE IT WITH ANOTHER </s>
<s> SEE THAT CHAPLET TIPPED WITH PEARLS BESIDE THE QUININE BOTTLE </s>
<s> EVEN THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH ALTHOUGH I HAD GOT IT OUT WITH THE DESIGN OF SENDING IT TO HER </s>
<s> YOU MY SONS WILL GIVE HER A FAIR SHARE OF THE AGRA TREASURE </s>
<s> BUT SEND HER NOTHING NOT EVEN THE CHAPLET UNTIL I AM GONE </s>

<s> MORSTAN HAD SPRUNG OUT OF HIS CHAIR IN A PAROXYSM OF ANGER WHEN HE SUDDENLY PRESSED HIS HAND TO HIS SIDE HIS FACE TURNED A DUSKY HUE AND HE FELL BACKWARD CUTTING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE TREASURE CHEST </s>

<s> FOR A LONG TIME I SAT HALF DISTRACTED WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD DO </s>
<s> MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS OF COURSE TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE BUT I COULD NOT BUT RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE THAT I WOULD BE ACCUSED OF HIS MURDER </s>
<s> HIS DEATH AT THE MOMENT OF A QUARREL AND THE GASH IN HIS HEAD WOULD BE BLACK AGAINST ME </s>
<s> AGAIN AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY COULD NOT BE MADE WITHOUT BRINGING OUT SOME FACTS ABOUT THE TREASURE WHICH I WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO KEEP SECRET </s>
<s> HE HAD TOLD ME THAT NO SOUL UPON EARTH KNEW WHERE HE HAD GONE </s>
<s> THERE SEEMED TO BE NO NECESSITY WHY ANY SOUL EVER SHOULD KNOW </s>
<s> I WAS STILL PONDERING OVER THE MATTER WHEN LOOKING UP I SAW MY SERVANT LAL CHOWDAR IN THE DOORWAY </s>
<s> HE STOLE IN AND BOLTED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE DO NOT FEAR SAHIB QUOTE HE SAID QUOTE NO ONE NEED KNOW THAT YOU HAVE KILLED HIM </s>
<s> LET US HIDE HIM AWAY AND WHO IS THE WISER </s>

<s> I HEARD IT ALL SAHIB SAID HE L. HEARD YOU QUARREL AND I HEARD THE BLOW </s>
<s> BUT MY LIPS ARE SEALED </s>
<s> ALL ARE ASLEEP IN THE HOUSE </s>
<s> LET US PUT HIM AWAY TOGETHER </s>

<s> THE THING SEEMS TO ME TO BE DEEPER AND MORE INEXPLICABLE </s>
<s> HOW FOR EXAMPLE COULD YOU DESCRIBE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE THE WOODENLEGGED MAN </s>
<s> PSHAW MY DEAR BOY IT WAS SIMPLICITY ITSELF </s>
<s> I DON'T WISH TO BE THEATRICAL </s>
<s> IT IS ALL PATENT AND ABOVE BOARD </s>
<s> TWO OFFICERS WHO ARE IN COMMAND OF A CONVICT GUARD LEARN AN IMPORTANT SECRET AS TO BURIED TREASURE </s>
<s> A MAP IS DRAWN FOR THEM BY AN ENGLISHMAN NAMED JONATHAN SMALL </s>
<s> YOU REMEMBER THAT WE SAW THE NAME UPON THE CHART IN CAPTAIN MORSTAN'S POSSESSION </s>
<s> HE HAD SIGNED IT IN BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND HIS ASSOCIATES THE SIGN OF THE FOUR AS HE SOMEWHAT DRAMATICALLY CALLED IT </s>
<s> AIDED BY THIS CHART THE OFFICERS OR ONE OF THEM GETS THE TREASURE AND BRINGS IT TO ENGLAND LEAVING WE WILL SUPPOSE SOME CONDITION UNDER WHICH HE RECEIVED IT UNFULFILLED </s>
<s> NOW THEN WHY DID NOT JONATHAN SMALL GET THE TREASURE HIMSELF </s>
<s> THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS </s>
<s> THE CHART IS DATED AT A TIME WHEN MORSTAN WAS BROUGHT INTO CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH CONVICTS </s>
<s> JONATHAN SMALL DID NOT GET THE TREASURE BECAUSE HE AND HIS ASSOCIATES WERE THEMSELVES CONVICTS AND COULD NOT GET AWAY </s>
<s> QUOTE BUT THIS IS MERE SPECULATION QUOTE SAID I </s>
<s> IT IS MORE THAN THAT </s>
<s> IT IS THE ONLY HYPOTHESIS WHICH COVERS THE FACTS </s>
<s> LET US SEE HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE SEQUEL </s>
<s> MAJOR SHOLTO REMAINS AT PEACE FOR SOME YEARS HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF HIS TREASURE </s>
<s> THEN HE RECEIVES A LETTER FROM INDIA WHICH GIVES HIM A GREAT FRIGHT </s>
<s> WHAT WAS THAT </s>
<s> A LETTER TO SAY THAT THE MEN WHOM HE HAD WRONGED HAD BEEN SET FREE </s>
<s> OR HAD ESCAPED </s>
<s> THAT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY FOR HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT THEIR TERM OF IMPRISONMENT WAS </s>
<s> IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE TO HIM </s>
<s> WHAT DOES HE DO THEN </s>
<s> HE GUARDS HIMSELF AGAINST A WOODEN LEGGED MAN A WHITE MAN MARK YOU FOR HE MISTAKES A WHITE TRADESMAN FOR HIM AND ACTUALLY FIRES A PISTOL AT HIM </s>
<s> NOW ONLY ONE WHITE MAN'S NAME IS ON THE CHART </s>
<s> THE OTHERS ARE HINDOOS OR MOHAMMEDANS </s>
<s> THERE IS NO OTHER WHITE MAN </s>
<s> THEREFORE WE MAY SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THE WOODEN LEGGED MAN IS IDENTICAL WITH JONATHAN SMALL </s>
<s> DOES THE REASONING STRIKE YOU AS BEING FAULTY </s>
<s> QUOTE NO IT IS CLEAR AND CONCISE QUOTE </s>
<s> WELL NOW LET US PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF JONATHAN SMALL </s>
<s> LET US LOOK AT IT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW </s>
<s> HE COMES TO ENGLAND WITH THE DOUBLE IDEA OF REGAINING WHAT HE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE HIS RIGHTS AND OF HAVING HIS REVENGE UPON THE MAN WHO HAD WRONGED HIM </s>
<s> HE FOUND OUT WHERE SHOLTO LIVED AND VERY POSSIBLY HE ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATIONS WITH SOMEONE INSIDE THE HOUSE </s>
<s> THERE IS THIS BUTLER LAL RAO WHOM WE HAVE NOT SEEN </s>
<s> MRS. BERNSTONE GIVES HIM FAR FROM A GOOD CHARACTER </s>
<s> SMALL COULD NOT FIND OUT HOWEVER WHERE THE TREASURE WAS HID FOR NO ONE EVER KNEW SAVE THE MAJOR AND ONE FAITHFUL SERVANT WHO HAD DIED </s>
<s> SUDDENLY SMALL LEARNS THAT THE MAJOR IS ON HIS DEATHBED LN A FRENZY LEST THE SECRET OF THE TREASURE DIE WITH HIM HE RUNS THE GAUNTLET OF THE GUARDS MAKES HIS WAY TO THE DYING MAN'S WINDOW AND IS ONLY DETERRED FROM ENTERING BY THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO SONS </s>
<s> MAD WITH HATE HOWEVER AGAINST THE DEAD MAN HE ENTERS THE ROOM THAT NIGHT SEARCHES HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING SOME MEMORANDUM RELATING TO THE TREASURE AND FINALLY LEAVES A MEMENTO OF HIS VISIT IN THE SHORT INSCRIPTION UPON THE CARD </s>
<s> HE HAD DOUBTLESS PLANNED BEFOREHAND THAT SHOULD HE SLAY THE MAJOR HE WOULD LEAVE SOME SUCH RECORD UPON THE BODY AS A SIGN THAT IT WAS NOT A COMMON MURDER BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE FOUR ASSOCIATES SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF AN ACT OF JUSTICE </s>
<s> WHIMSICAL AND BIZARRE CONCEITS OF THIS KIND ARE COMMON ENOUGH IN THE ANNALS OF CRIME AND USUALLY AFFORD VALUABLE INDICATIONS AS TO THE CRIMINAL </s>
<s> DO YOU FOLLOW ALL THIS </s>
<s> VERY CLEARLY </s>
<s> NOW WHAT COULD JONATHAN SMALL DO </s>
<s> HE COULD ONLY CONTINUE TO KEEP A SECRET WATCH UPON THE EFFORTS MADE TO FIND THE TREASURE </s>
<s> POSSIBLY HE LEAVES ENGLAND AND ONLY COMES BACK AT INTERVALS </s>
<s> THEN COMES THE DISCOVERY OF THE GARRET AND HE IS INSTANTLY INFORMED OF IT </s>
<s> WE AGAIN TRACE THE PRESENCE OF SOME CONFEDERATE IN THE HOUSEHOLD </s>
<s> JONATHAN WITH HIS WOODEN LEG IS UTTERLY UNABLE TO REACH THE LOFTY ROOM OF BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO </s>
<s> HE TAKES WITH HIM HOWEVER A RATHER CURIOUS ASSOCIATE WHO GETS OVER THIS DIFFICULTY BUT DIPS HIS NAKED FOOT INTO CREOSOTE WHENCE COME TOBY AND A SIX MILE LIMP FOR A HALF PAY OFFICER WITH A DAMAGED TENDO ACHILLIS </s>

<s> AS HE LEANED UPON A THICK OAKEN CUDGEL HIS SHOULDERS HEAVED IN THE EFFORT TO DRAW THE AIR INTO HIS LUNGS </s>

<s> HE SPOKE ON A QUICK SUCCESSION OF SUBJECTS ON MIRACLE PLAYS ON MEDIEVAL POTTERY ON STRADIVARIUS VIOLINS ON THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON AND ON THE WARSHIPS OF THE FUTURE HANDLING EACH AS THOUGH HE HAD MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF IT </s>

<s> I KNEW THAT THIS MAN SMALL HAD A CERTAIN DEGREE OF LOW CUNNING BUT I DID NOT THINK HIM CAPABLE OF ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF DELICATE FINESSE </s>
<s> THAT IS USUALLY A PRODUCT OF HIGHER EDUCATION </s>
<s> I THEN REFLECTED THAT SINCE HE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN IN LONDON SOME TIME AS WE HAD EVIDENCE THAT HE MAINTAINED A CONTINUAL WATCH OVER PONDICHERRY LODGE HE COULD HARDLY LEAVE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE BUT WOULD NEED SOME LITTLE TIME IF IT WERE ONLY A DAY TO ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS </s>

<s> BUT THE LAUNCH </s>
<s> THEY COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THAT TO THEIR LODGINGS </s>

<s> I THEN PUT MYSELF IN THE PLACE OF SMALL AND LOOKED AT IT AS A MAN OF HIS CAPACITY WOULD </s>
<s> HE WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER THAT TO SEND BACK THE LAUNCH OR TO KEEP IT AT A WHARF WOULD MAKE PURSUIT EASY IF THE POLICE DID HAPPEN TO GET ON HIS TRACK </s>
<s> HOW THEN COULD HE CONCEAL THE LAUNCH AND YET HAVE HER AT HAND WHEN WANTED </s>

<s> I COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY OF DOING IT </s>
<s> I MIGHT HAND THE LAUNCH OVER TO SOME BOAT BUILDER OR REPAIRER WITH DIRECTIONS TO MAKE A TRIFLING CHANGE IN HER </s>

<s> EVERYWHERE ELSE THEY WERE HELPLESS FUGITIVES </s>
<s> IT WAS A FIGHT OF THE MILLIONS AGAINST THE HUNDREDS AND THE CRUELLEST PART OF IT WAS THAT THESE MEN THAT WE FOUGHT AGAINST FOOT HORSE AND GUNNERS WERE OUR OWN PICKED TROOPS WHOM WE HAD TAUGHT AND TRAINED HANDLING OUR OWN WEAPONS AND BLOWING OUR OWN BUGLE CALLS </s>

<s> I SHOULD THINK THAT THE ENCLOSURE MUST BE ACRES AND ACRES </s>

<s> THE RIVER WASHES ALONG THE FRONT OF THE OLD FORT AND SO PROTECTS IT BUT ON THE SIDES AND BEHIND THERE ARE MANY DOORS AND THESE HAD TO BE GUARDED OF COURSE IN THE OLD QUARTER AS WELL AS IN THAT WHICH WAS ACTUALLY HELD BY OUR TROOPS </s>

<s> TO ESCAPE TO TRACK DOWN SHOLTO TO HAVE MY HAND UPON HIS THROAT THAT WAS MY ONE THOUGHT </s>

<s> WELL I HAVE SET MY MIND ON MANY THINGS IN THIS LIFE AND NEVER ONE WHICH I DID NOT CARRY OUT </s>
<s> BUT IT WAS WEARY YEARS BEFORE MY TIME CAME </s>
<s> I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I HAD PICKED UP SOMETHING OF MEDICINE </s>
<s> ONE DAY WHEN DOCTOR SOMERTON WAS DOWN WITH A FEVER A LITTLE ANDAMAN ISLANDER WAS PICKED UP BY A CONVICT GANG IN THE WOODS </s>

<s> HE WAS TO BRING HIS BOAT ROUND ON A CERTAIN NIGHT TO AN OLD WHARF WHICH WAS NEVER GUARDED AND THERE HE WAS TO PICK ME UP </s>
<s> I GAVE HIM DIRECTIONS TO HAVE SEVERAL GOURDS OF WATER AND A LOT OF YAMS COCOANUTS AND SWEET POTATOES </s>

<s> NO MAN EVER HAD A MORE FAITHFUL MATE </s>
<s> AT THE NIGHT NAMED HE HAD HIS BOAT AT THE WHARF </s>
<s> AS IT CHANCED HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE OF THE CONVICTGUARD DOWN THERE A VILE PATHAN WHO HAD NEVER MISSED A CHANCE OF INSULTING AND INJURING ME </s>
<s> I HAD ALWAYS VOWED VENGEANCE AND NOW I HAD MY CHANCE </s>
<s> IT WAS AS IF FATE HAD PLACED HIM IN MY WAY THAT I MIGHT PAY MY DEBT BEFORE I LEFT THE ISLAND </s>
<s> HE STOOD ON THE BANK WITH HIS BACK TO ME AND HIS CARBINE ON HIS SHOULDER </s>
<s> I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A STONE TO BEAT OUT HIS BRAINS WITH BUT NONE COULD I SEE </s>
<s> THEN A QUEER THOUGHT CAME INTO MY HEAD AND SHOWED ME WHERE I COULD LAY MY HAND ON A WEAPON </s>
<s> I SAT DOWN IN THE DARKNESS AND UNSTRAPPED MY WOODEN LEG </s>
<s> WITH THREE LONG HOPS I WAS ON HIM </s>
<s> HE PUT HIS CARBINE TO HIS SHOULDER BUT I STRUCK HIM FULL AND KNOCKED THE WHOLE FRONT OF HIS SKULL IN </s>
<s> YOU CAN SEE THE SPLIT IN THE WOOD NOW WHERE I HIT HIM </s>
<s> WE BOTH WENT DOWN TOGETHER FOR I COULD NOT KEEP MY BALANCE BUT WHEN I GOT UP I FOUND HIM STILL LYING QUIET ENOUGH </s>
<s> I MADE FOR THE BOAT AND IN AN HOUR WE WERE WELL OUT AT SEA </s>
<s> TONGA HAD BROUGHT ALL HIS EARTHLY POSSESSIONS WITH HIM HIS ARMS AND HIS GODS </s>
<s> AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD A LONG BAMBOO SPEAR AND SOME ANDAMAN COCOANUT MATTING WITH WHICH I MADE A SORT OF A SAIL </s>

<s> THEY WERE A RUM CROWD AND TONGA AND I SOON MANAGED TO SETTLE DOWN AMONG THEM </s>
<s> THEY HAD ONE VERY GOOD QUALITY THEY LET YOU ALONE AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS </s>
<s> WELL IF I WERE TO TELL YOU ALL THE ADVENTURES THAT MY LITTLE CHUM AND I WENT THROUGH YOU WOULD NOT THANK ME FOR I WOULD HAVE YOU HERE UNTIL THE SUN WAS SHINING </s>
<s> HERE AND THERE WE DRIFTED ABOUT THE WORLD SOMETHING ALWAYS TURNING UP TO KEEP US FROM LONDON </s>
<s> ALL THE TIME HOWEVER I NEVER LOST SIGHT OF MY PURPOSE </s>
<s> I WOULD DREAM OF SHOLTO AT NIGHT </s>
<s> A HUNDRED TIMES I HAVE KILLED HIM IN MY SLEEP </s>
<s> AT LAST HOWEVER SOME THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WE FOUND OURSELVES IN ENGLAND </s>
<s> I HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WHERE SHOLTO LIVED AND I SET TO WORK TO DISCOVER WHETHER HE HAD REALIZED ON THE TREASURE OR IF HE STILL HAD IT </s>
<s> I MADE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP ME I NAME NO NAMES FOR I DON'T WANT TO GET ANYONE ELSE IN A HOLE AND I SOON FOUND THAT HE STILL HAD THE JEWELS </s>
<s> THEN I TRIED TO GET AT HIM IN MANY WAYS BUT HE WAS PRETTY SLY AND HAD ALWAYS TWO PRIZEFIGHTERS BESIDES HIS SONS AND HIS KHITMUTGAR ON GUARD OVER HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE ONE DAY HOWEVER I GOT WORD THAT HE WAS DYING </s>
<s> I HURRIED AT ONCE TO THE GARDEN MAD THAT HE SHOULD SLIP OUT OF MY CLUTCHES LIKE THAT AND LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW I SAW HIM LYING IN HIS BED WITH HIS SONS ON EACH SIDE OF HIM </s>
<s> I'D HAVE COME THROUGH AND TAKEN MY CHANCE WITH THE THREE OF THEM ONLY EVEN AS I LOOKED AT HIM HIS JAW DROPPED AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS GONE </s>
<s> I GOT INTO HIS ROOM THAT SAME NIGHT THOUGH AND I SEARCHED HIS PAPERS TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RECORD OF WHERE HE HAD HIDDEN OUR JEWELS </s>
<s> THERE WAS NOT A LINE HOWEVER SO I CAME AWAY BITTER AND SAVAGE AS A MAN COULD BE </s>
<s> BEFORE I LEFT I BETHOUGHT ME THAT IF I EVER MET MY SIKH FRIENDS AGAIN IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT I HAD LEFT SOME MARK OF OUR HATRED SO I SCRAWLED DOWN THE SIGN OF THE FOUR OF US AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE CHART AND I PINNED IT ON HIS BOSOM </s>
<s> IT WAS TOO MUCH THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE GRAVE WITHOUT SOME TOKEN FROM THE MEN WHOM HE HAD ROBBED AND BEFOOLED </s>

<s> HE WOULD EAT RAW MEAT AND DANCE HIS WAR DANCE SO WE ALWAYS HAD A HATFUL OF PENNIES AFTER A DAY'S WORK </s>
<s> I STILL HEARD ALL THE NEWS FROM PONDICHERRY LODGE AND FOR SOME YEARS THERE WAS NO NEWS TO HEAR EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE HUNTING FOR THE TREASURE </s>
<s> AT LAST HOWEVER CAME WHAT WE HAD WAITED FOR SO LONG </s>
<s> THE TREASURE HAD BEEN FOUND </s>
<s> IT WAS UP AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE IN MR. BANHOLOMEW SHOLTO'S CHEMICAL LABORATORY </s>
<s> I CAME AT ONCE AND HAD A LOOK AT THE PLACE BUT I COULD NOT SEE HOW WITH MY WOODEN LEG I WAS TO MAKE MY WAY UP TO IT </s>
<s> I LEARNED HOWEVER ABOUT A TRAPDOOR IN THE ROOF AND ALSO ABOUT MR. SHOLTO'S SUPPER HOUR </s>
<s> IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I COULD MANAGE THE THING EASILY THROUGH TONGA </s>
<s> I BROUGHT HIM OUT WITH ME WITH A LONG ROPE WOUND ROUND HIS WAIST </s>
<s> HE COULD CLIMB LIKE A CAT AND HE SOON MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROOF BUT AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO WAS STILL IN THE ROOM TO HIS COST </s>
<s> TONGA THOUGHT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING VERY CLEVER IN KILLING HIM FOR WHEN I CAME UP BY THE ROPE I FOUND HIM STRUTTING ABOUT AS PROUD AS A PEACOCK </s>
<s> VERY MUCH SURPRISED WAS HE WHEN I MADE AT HIM WITH THE ROPE'S END AND CURSED HIM FOR A LITTLE BLOODTHIRSTY IMP </s>
<s> I TOOK THE TREASURE BOX AND LET IT DOWN AND THEN SLID DOWN MYSELF HAVING FIRST LEFT THE SIGN OF THE FOUR UPON THE TABLE TO SHOW THAT THE JEWELS HAD COME BACK AT LAST TO THOSE WHO HAD MOST RIGHT TO THEM </s>
<s> TONGA THEN PULLED UP THE ROPE CLOSED THE WINDOW AND MADE OFF THE WAY THAT HE HAD COME </s>
<s> I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO TELL YOU </s>
<s> I HAD HEARD A WATERMAN SPEAK OF THE SPEED OF SMITH'S LAUNCH THE AURORA SO L. THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE A HANDY CRAFT FOR OUR ESCAPE WITH OLD SMITH AND WAS TO GIVE HIM A BIG SUM IF HE GOT US SAFE TO OUR SHIP </s>
<s> HE KNEW NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS SOME SCREW LOOSE BUT HE WAS NOT IN OUR SECRETS </s>
<s> ALL THIS IS THE TRUTH AND IF I TELL IT TO YOU GENTLEMEN IT IS NOT TO AMUSE YOU FOR YOU HAVE NOT DONE ME A VERY GOOD TURN BUT IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE BEST DEFENCE I CAN MAKE IS JUST TO HOLD BACK NOTHING BUT LET ALL THE WORLD KNOW HOW BADLY I HAVE MYSELF BEEN SERVED BY MAJOR SHOLTO AND HOW INNOCENT I AM OF THE DEATH OF HIS SON </s>
