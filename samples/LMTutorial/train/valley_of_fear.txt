<s> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT HOLMES </s>
<s> IT IS OBVIOUSLY AN ATTEMPT TO CONVEY SECRET INFORMATION </s>
<s> QUOTE BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF A CIPHER MESSAGE WITHOUT THE CIPHER QUOTE </s>
<s> IN THIS INSTANCE NONE AT ALL </s>
<s> WHY DO YOU SAY IN THIS INSTANCE </s>
<s> BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY CIPHERS WHICH I WOULD READ AS EASILY AS I DO THE APOCRYPHA OF THE AGONY COLUMN SUCH CRUDE DEVICES AMUSE THE INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT FATIGUING IT </s>

<s> I TRUST THAT THE MAN PORLOCK WILL COME TO NO HARM </s>
<s> DEAR MR. HOLMES HE SAYS I WILL GO NO FURTHER IN THIS MANER </s>
<s> IT IS TOO DANGEROUS HE SUSPECTS ME </s>

<s> ANYHOW FRIEND PORLOCK IS EVIDENTLY SCARED OUT OF HIS SENSES KINDLY COMPARE THE WRITING IN THE NOTE TO THAT UPON ITS ENVELOPE WHICH WAS DONE HE TELLS US BEFORE THIS ILL OMENED VISIT </s>
<s> THE ONE IS CLEAR AND FIRM </s>
<s> THE OTHER HARDLY LEGIBLE </s>
<s> WHY DID HE WRITE AT ALL </s>
<s> WHY DID HE NOT SIMPLY DROP IT QUOTE </s>
<s> BECAUSE HE FEARED I WOULD MAKE SOME INQUIRY AFTER HIM IN THAT CASE AND POSSIBLY BRING TROUBLE ON HIM </s>
<s> NO DOUBT SAID I. OF COURSE </s>
<s> I HAD PICKED UP THE ORIGINAL CIPHER MESSAGE AND WAS BENDING MY BROWS OVER IT </s>
<s> IT'S PRETTY MADDENING TO THINK THAT AN IMPORTANT SECRET MAY LIE HERE ON THIS SLIP OF PAPER AND THAT IT IS BEYOND HUMAN POWER TO PENETRATE IT </s>
<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD PUSHED AWAY HIS UNTASTED BREAKFAST AND LIT THE UNSAVOURY PIPE WHICH WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DEEPEST MEDITATIONS </s>
<s> I WONDER SAID HE LEANING BACK AND STARING AT THE CEILING </s>
<s> PERHAPS THERE ARE POINTS WHICH HAVE ESCAPED YOUR MACHIAVELLIAN INTELLECT </s>
<s> LET US CONSIDER THE PROBLEM IN THE LIGHT OF PURE REASON </s>
<s> THIS MAN'S REFERENCE IS TO A BOOK </s>
<s> THAT IS OUR POINT OF DEPARTURE QUOTE </s>
<s> A SOMEWHAT VAGUE ONE </s>
<s> LET US SEE THEN IF WE CAN NARROW IT DOWN </s>
<s> AS I FOCUS MY MIND UPON IT IT SEEMS RATHER LESS IMPENETRABLE </s>
<s> WHAT INDICATIONS HAVE WE AS TO THIS BOOK </s>
<s> NONE </s>
<s> WELL WELL IT IS SURELY NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT </s>
<s> THE CIPHER MESSAGE BEGINS WITH A LARGE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DOES IT NOT </s>
<s> WE MAY TAKE IT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS THAT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR IS THE PARTICULAR PAGE TO WHICH THE CIPHER REFERS </s>
<s> SO OUR BOOK HAS ALREADY BECOME A LARGE BOOK WHICH IS SURELY SOMETHING GAINED </s>
<s> WHAT OTHER INDICATIONS HAVE WE AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS LARGE BOOK </s>
<s> THE NEXT SIGN IS C. TWO </s>

<s> SO NOW YOU SEE WE BEGIN TO VISUALIZE A LARGE BOOK PRINTED IN DOUBLE COLUMNS WHICH ARE EACH OF A CONSIDERABLE IENGTH SINCE ONE OF THE WORDS IS NUMBERED IN THE DOCUMENT AS THE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETYTHIRD </s>
<s> HAVE WE REACHED THE LIMITS OF WHAT REASON CAN SUPPLY QUOTE </s>
<s> I FEAR THAT WE HAVE </s>
<s> SURELY YOU DO YOURSELF AN INJUSTICE </s>
<s> ONE MORE CORUSCATION MY DEAR WATSON YET ANOTHER BRAIN WAVE </s>
<s> HAD THE VOLUME BEEN AN UNUSUAL ONE HE WOULD HAVE SENT IT TO ME </s>
<s> INSTEAD OF THAT HE HAD INTENDED BEFORE HIS PLANS WERE NIPPED TO SEND ME THE CLUE IN THIS ENVELOPE </s>
<s> HE SAYS SO IN HIS NOTE </s>
<s> THIS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE BOOK IS ONE WHICH HE THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING FOR MYSELF </s>
<s> HE HAD IT AND HE IMAGINED THAT I WOULD HAVE IT TOO </s>
<s> IN SHORT WATSON IT IS A VERY COMMON BOOK </s>
<s> WHAT YOU SAY CERTAINLY SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE </s>

<s> QUOTE THE BIBLE QUOTE </s>
<s> I CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY </s>

<s> BESIDES THE EDITIONS OF HOLY WRIT ARE SO NUMEROUS THAT HE COULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT TWO COPIES WOULD HAVE THE SAME PAGINATION </s>
<s> THIS IS CLEARLY A BOOK WHICH IS STANDARDIZED </s>
<s> HE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN THAT HIS PAGE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR WILL EXACTLY AGREE WITH MY PAGE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR </s>
<s> BUT VERY FEW BOOKS WOULD CORRESPOND WITH THAT </s>
<s> EXACTLY </s>
<s> THEREIN LIES OUR SALVATION </s>
<s> OUR SEARCH IS NARROWED DOWN TO STANDARDIZED BOOKS WHICH ANYONE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO POSSESS </s>
<s> QUOTE BRADSHAW QUOTE </s>
<s> THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES WATSON </s>
<s> THE VOCABULARY OF BRADSHAW IS NERVOUS AND TERSE BUT LIMITED </s>
<s> THE SELECTION OF WORDS WOULD HARDLY LEND ITSELF TO THE SENDING OF GENERAL MESSAGES </s>

<s> ALAS THE NEXT WORD IS PIG'S BRISTLES </s>
<s> WE ARE UNDONE MY GOOD WATSON </s>

<s> NOW LET US SEE WHAT PAGE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR HAS IN STORE FOR US </s>
<s> NUMBER THIRTEEN IS THERE WHICH IS MUCH MORE PROMISING </s>

<s> QUOTE WHAT A QUEER SCRAMBLING WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS MEANING QUOTE SAID I </s>
<s> ON THE CONTRARY HE HAS DONE QUITE REMARKABLY WELL SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> WHEN YOU SEARCH A SINGLE COLUMN FOR WORDS WITH WHICH TO EXPRESS YOUR MEANING YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT TO GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT </s>
<s> YOU ARE BOUND TO LEAVE SOMETHING TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR CORRESPONDENT </s>
<s> THE PURPORT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR </s>
<s> SOME DEVILTRY IS INTENDED AGAINST ONE DOUGLAS WHOEVER HE MAY BE RESIDING AS STATED A RICH COUNTRY GENTLEMAN </s>
<s> HE IS SURE CONFIDENCE WAS AS NEAR AS HE COULD GET TO CONFIDENT THAT IT IS PRESSING </s>
<s> THERE IS OUR RESULT AND A VERY WORKMANLIKE LITTLE BIT OF ANALYSIS IT WAS </s>

<s> THOSE WERE THE EARLY DAYS AT THE END OF THE EIGHTY'S WHEN ALEC MACDONALD WAS FAR FROM HAVING ATTAINED THE NATIONAL FAME WHICH HE HAS NOW ACHIEVED </s>
<s> HE WAS A YOUNG BUT TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE DETECTIVE FORCE WHO HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN SEVERAL CASES WHICH HAD BEEN INTRUSTED TO HIM </s>
<s> HIS TALL BONY FIGURE GAVE PROMISE OF EXCEPTIONAL PHYSICAL STRENGTH WHILE HIS GREAT CRANIUM AND DEEP SET LUSTROUS EYES SPOKE NO LESS CLEARLY OF THE KEEN INTELLIGENCE WHICH TWINKLED OUT FROM BEHIND HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS </s>

<s> TWICE ALREADY IN HIS CAREER HAD HOLMES HELPED HIM TO ATTAIN SUCCESS HIS OWN SOLE REWARD BEING THE INTELLECTUAL JOY OF THE PROBLEM </s>
<s> FOR THIS REASON THE AFFECTION AND RESPECT OF THE SCOTCHMAN FOR HIS AMATEUR COLLEAGUE WERE PROFOUND AND HE SHOWED THEM BY THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH HE CONSULTED HOLMES IN EVERY DIFFICULTY </s>
<s> MEDIOCRITY KNOWS NOTHING HIGHER THAN ITSELF BUT TALENT INSTANTLY RECOGNIZES GENIUS AND MACDONALD HAD TALENT ENOUGH FOR HIS PROFESSION TO ENABLE HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS NO HUMILIATION IN SEEKING THE ASSISTANCE OF ONE WHO ALREADY STOOD ALONE IN EUROPE BOTH IN HIS GIFTS AND IN HIS EXPERIENCE </s>
<s> HOLMES WAS NOT PRONE TO FRIENDSHIP BUT HE WAS TOLERANT OF THE BIG SCOTCHMAN AND SMILED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM </s>
<s> YOU ARE AN EARLY BIRD MR. MAC SAID HE </s>
<s> I WISH YOU LUCK WITH YOUR WORM </s>

<s> THAT'S PAYING FOR BRAINS YOU SEE THE AMERICAN BUSINESS PRINCIPLE </s>
<s> I LEARNED THAT DETAIL QUITE BY CHANCE </s>
<s> IT'S MORE THAN THE PRIME MINISTER GETS </s>
<s> THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF MORIARTY'S GAINS AND OF THE SCALE ON WHICH HE WORKS </s>
<s> ANOTHER POINT I MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO HUNT DOWN SOME OF MORIARTY'S CHECKS LATELY JUST COMMON INNOCENT CHECKS THAT HE PAYS HIS HOUSEHOLD BILLS WITH </s>

<s> DOES THAT MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON YOUR MIND </s>
<s> QUOTE QUEER CERTAINLY </s>
<s> BUT WHAT DO YOU GATHER FROM IT </s>
<s> THAT HE WANTED NO GOSSIP ABOUT HIS WEALTH </s>
<s> NO SINGLE MAN SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE HAD </s>
<s> I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS TWENTY BANKING ACCOUNTS THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE ABROAD IN THE DEUTSCHE BANK OR THE CREDIT LYONNAIS AS LIKELY AS NOT </s>

<s> NOW HIS PRACTICAL SCOTCH INTELLIGENCE BROUGHT HIM BACK WITH A SNAP TO THE MATTER IN HAND </s>
<s> HE CAN KEEP ANYHOW SAID HE </s>
<s> YOU'VE GOT US SIDE TRACKED WITH YOUR INTERESTING ANECDOTES MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> WHAT REALLY COUNTS IS YOUR REMARK THAT THERE IS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PROFESSOR AND THE CRIME </s>
<s> THAT YOU GET FROM THE WARNING RECEIVED THROUGH THE MAN PORLOCK </s>
<s> CAN WE FOR OUR PRESENT PRACTICAL NEEDS GET ANY FURTHER THAN THAT QUOTE </s>
<s> WE MAY FORM SOME CONCEPTION AS TO THE MOTIVES OF THE CRIME </s>
<s> IT IS AS I GATHER FROM YOUR ORIGINAL REMARKS AN INEXPLICABLE OR AT LEAST AN UNEXPLAINED MURDER </s>
<s> NOW PRESUMING THAT THE SOURCE OF THE CRIME IS AS WE SUSPECT IT TO BE THERE MIGHT BE TWO DIFFERENT MOTIVES </s>
<s> IN THE FIRST PLACE I MAY TELL YOU THAT MORIARTY RULES WITH A ROD OF IRON OVER HIS PEOPLE </s>
<s> HIS DISCIPLINE IS TREMENDOUS </s>
<s> THERE IS ONLY ONE PUNISHMENT IN HIS CODE </s>
<s> IT IS DEATH </s>
<s> NOW WE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THIS MURDERED MAN THIS DOUGLAS WHOSE APPROACHING FATE WAS KNOWN BY ONE OF THE ARCH CRIMINAL'S SUBORDINATES HAD IN SOME WAY BETRAYED THE CHIEF </s>
<s> HIS PUNISHMENT FOLLOWED AND WOULD BE KNOWN TO ALL IF ONLY TO PUT THE FEAR OF DEATH INTO THEM </s>
<s> WELL THAT IS ONE SUGGESTION MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> THE OTHER IS THAT IT HAS BEEN ENGINEERED BY MORIARTY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS </s>
<s> WAS THERE ANY ROBBERY </s>
<s> QUOTE I HAVE NOT HEARD QUOTE </s>
<s> IF SO IT WOULD OF COURSE BE AGAINST THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS AND IN FAVOUR OF THE SECOND </s>
<s> MORIARTY MAY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED TO ENGINEER IT ON A PROMISE OF PART SPOILS OR HE MAY HAVE BEEN PAID SO MUCH DOWN TO MANAGE IT </s>
<s> EITHER IS POSSIBLE </s>
<s> BUT WHICHEVER IT MAY BE OR IF IT IS SOME THIRD COMBINATION IT IS DOWN AT BIRLSTONE THAT WE MUST SEEK THE SOLUTION </s>

<s> THAT WAS IN THE INCLOSED OFFICIAL REPORT </s>
<s> IT DIDN'T SAY HORRIBLE THAT'S NOT A RECOGNIZED OFFICIAL TERM </s>
<s> IT GAVE THE NAME JOHN DOUGLAS </s>
<s> IT MENTIONED THAT HIS INJURIES HAD BEEN IN THE HEAD FROM THE DISCHARGE OF A SHOTGUN </s>
<s> IT ALSO MENTIONED THE HOUR OF THE ALARM WHICH WAS CLOSE ON TO MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT </s>
<s> IT ADDED THAT THE CASE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF MURDER BUT THAT NO ARREST HAD BEEN MADE AND THAT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH PRESENTED SOME VERY PERPLEXING AND EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES </s>
<s> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ALL WE HAVE AT PRESENT MR. HOLMES </s>

<s> CHAPTER THREE THE TRAGEDY OF BIRLSTONE </s>
<s> NOW FOR A MOMENT I WILL ASK LEAVE TO REMOVE MY OWN INSIGNIFICANT PERSONALITY AND TO DESCRIBE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED BEFORE WE ARRIVED UPON THE SCENE BY THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAME TO US AFTERWARDS </s>
<s> ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN I MAKE THE READER APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE CONCERNED AND THE STRANGE SETTING IN WHICH THEIR FATE WAS CAST </s>
<s> THE VILLAGE OF BIRLSTONE IS A SMALL AND VERY ANCIENT CLUSTER OF HALF TIMBERED COTTAGES ON THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE COUNTY OF SUSSEX </s>
<s> FOR CENTURIES IT HAD REMAINED UNCHANGED BUT WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS ITS PICTURESQUE APPEARANCE AND SITUATION HAVE ATTRACTED A NUMBER OF WELL TO DO RESIDENTS WHOSE VILLAS PEEP OUT FROM THE WOODS AROUND </s>
<s> THESE WOODS ARE LOCALLY SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXTREME FRINGE OF THE GREAT WEALD FOREST WHICH THINS AWAY UNTIL IT REACHES THE NORTHERN CHALK DOWNS </s>
<s> A NUMBER OF SMALL SHOPS HAVE COME INTO BEING TO MEET THE WANTS OF THE INCREASED POPULATION SO THERE SEEMS SOME PROSPECT THAT BIRLSTONE MAY SOON GROW FROM AN ANCIENT VILLAGE INTO A MODERN TOWN </s>
<s> IT IS THE CENTRE FOR A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF COUNTRY SINCE TUNBRIDGE WELLS THE NEAREST PLACE OF IMPORTANCE IS TEN OR TWELVE MILES TO THE EASTWARD OVER THE BORDERS OF KENT </s>
<s> ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE TOWN STANDING IN AN OLD PARK FAMOUS FOR ITS HUGE BEECH TREES IS THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE OF BIRLSTONE </s>
<s> PART OF THIS VENERABLE BUILDING DATES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE FIRST CRUSADE WHEN HUGO DE CAPUS BUILT A FORTALICE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ESTATE WHICH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM BY THE RED KING </s>
<s> THIS WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE AND SOME OF ITS SMOKE BLACKENED CORNER STONES WERE USED WHEN IN JACOBEAN TIMES A BRICK COUNTRY HOUSE ROSE UPON THE RUINS OF THE FEUDAL CASTLE </s>
<s> THE MANOR HOUSE WITH ITS MANY GABLES AND ITS SMALL DIAMONDPANED WINDOWS WAS STILL MUCH AS THE BUILDER HAD LEFT IT IN THE EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY </s>
<s> OF THE DOUBLE MOATS WHICH HAD GUARDED ITS MORE WARLIKE PREDECESSOR THE OUTER HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DRY UP AND SERVED THE HUMBLE FUNCTION OF A KITCHEN GARDEN </s>
<s> THE INNER ONE WAS STILL THERE AND LAY FORTY FEET IN BREADTH THOUGH NOW ONLY A FEW FEET IN DEPTH ROUND THE WHOLE HOUSE </s>
<s> A SMALL STREAM FED IT AND CONTINUED BEYOND IT SO THAT THE SHEET OF WATER THOUGH TURBID WAS NEVER DITCHLIKE OR UNHEALTHY </s>
<s> THE GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS WERE WITHIN A FOOT OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER </s>
<s> THE ONLY APPROACH TO THE HOUSE WAS OVER A DRAWBRIDGE THE CHAINS AND WINDLASS OF WHICH HAD LONG BEEN RUSTED AND BROKEN </s>
<s> THE LATEST TENANTS OF THE MANOR HOUSE HAD HOWEVER WITH CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY SET THIS RIGHT AND THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS NOT ONLY CAPABLE OF BEING RAISED BUT ACTUALLY WAS RAISED EVERY EVENING AND LOWERED EVERY MORNING </s>
<s> BY THUS RENEWING THE CUSTOM OF THE OLD FEUDAL DAYS THE MANOR HOUSE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN ISLAND DURING THE NIGHT A FACT WHICH HAD A VERY DIRECT BEARING UPON THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS SOON TO ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF ALL ENGLAND </s>
<s> THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNTENANTED FOR SOME YEARS AND WAS THREATENING TO MOULDER INTO A PICTURESQUE DECAY WHEN THE DOUGLASES TOOK POSSESSION OF IT </s>
<s> THIS FAMILY CONSISTED OF ONLY TWO INDIVIDUALS JOHN DOUGLAS AND HIS WIFE </s>
<s> DOUGLAS WAS A REMARKABLE MAN BOTH IN CHARACTER AND IN PERSON </s>
<s> IN AGE HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIFTY WITH A STRONGJAWED RUGGED FACE A GRIZZLING MOUSTACHE PECULIARLY KEEN GRAY EYES AND A WIRY VIGOROUS FIGURE WHICH HAD LOST NOTHING OF THE STRENGTH AND ACTIVITY OF YOUTH </s>
<s> HE WAS CHEERY AND GENIAL TO ALL BUT SOMEWHAT OFFHAND IN HIS MANNERS GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD SEEN LIFE IN SOCIAL STRATA ON SOME FAR LOWER HORIZON THAN THE COUNTY SOCIETY OF SUSSEX </s>
<s> YET THOUGH LOOKED AT WITH SOME CURIOSITY AND RESERVE BY HIS MORE CULTIVATED NEIGHBOURS HE SOON ACQUIRED A GREAT POPULARITY AMONG THE VILLAGERS SUBSCRIBING HANDSOMELY TO ALL LOCAL OBJECTS AND ATTENDING THEIR SMOKING CONCERTS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS WHERE HAVING A REMARKABLY RICH TENOR VOICE HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO OBLIGE WITH AN EXCELLENT SONG </s>
<s> HE APPEARED TO HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY WHICH WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN GAINED IN THE CALIFORNIA GOLD FIELDS AND IT WAS CLEAR FROM HIS OWN TALK AND THAT OF HIS WIFE THAT HE HAD SPENT A PART OF HIS LIFE IN AMERICA </s>
<s> THE GOOD IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY HIS GENEROSITY AND BY HIS DEMOCRATIC MANNERS WAS INCREASED BY A REPUTATION GAINED FOR UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER </s>
<s> THOUGH A WRETCHED RIDER HE TURNED OUT AT EVERY MEET AND TOOK THE MOST AMAZING FALLS IN HIS DETERMINATION TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH THE BEST </s>
<s> WHEN THE VICARAGE CAUGHT FIRE HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ALSO BY THE FEARLESSNESS WITH WHICH HE REENTERED THE BUILDING TO SAVE PROPERTY AFTER THE LOCAL FIRE BRIGADE HAD GIVEN IT UP AS IMPOSSIBLE </s>
<s> THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT JOHN DOUGLAS OF THE MANOR HOUSE HAD WITHIN FIVE YEARS WON HIMSELF QUITE A REPUTATION IN BIRLSTONE </s>
<s> HIS WIFE TOO WAS POPULAR WITH THOSE WHO HAD MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE THOUGH AFTER THE ENGLISH FASHION THE CALLERS UPON A STRANGER WHO SETTLED IN THE COUNTY WITHOUT INTRODUCTIONS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN </s>
<s> THIS MATTERED THE LESS TO HER AS SHE WAS RETIRING BY DISPOSITION AND VERY MUCH ABSORBED TO ALL APPEARANCE IN HER HUSBAND AND HER DOMESTIC DUTIES </s>
<s> IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS AN ENGLISH LADY WHO HAD MET MR. DOUGLAS IN LONDON HE BEING AT THAT TIME A WIDOWER </s>
<s> SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TALL DARK AND SLENDER SOME TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND A DISPARITY WHICH SEEMED IN NO WISE TO MAR THE CONTENTMENT OF THEIR FAMILY LIFE </s>
<s> IT WAS REMARKED SOMETIMES HOWEVER BY THOSE WHO KNEW THEM BEST THAT THE CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO DID NOT APPEAR TO BE COMPLETE SINCE THE WIFE WAS EITHER VERY RETICENT ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S PAST LIFE OR ELSE AS SEEMED MORE LIKELY WAS IMPERFECTLY INFORMED ABOUT IT </s>
<s> IT HAD ALSO BEEN NOTED AND COMMENTED UPON BY A FEW OBSERVANT PEOPLE THAT THERE WERE SIGNS SOMETIMES OF SOME NERVE STRAIN UPON THE PART OF MRS. DOUGLAS AND THAT SHE WOULD DISPLAY ACUTE UNEASINESS IF HER ABSENT HUSBAND SHOULD EVER BE PATTICULARLY LATE IN HIS RETURN </s>
<s> ON A QUIET COUNTRYSIDE WHERE ALL GOSSIP IS WELCOME THIS WEAKNESS OF THE LADY OF THE MANOR HOUSE DID NOT PASS WITHOUT REMARK AND IT BULKED LARGER UPON PEOPLE'S MEMORY WHEN THE EVENTS AROSE WHICH GAVE IT A VERY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE </s>
<s> THERE WAS YET ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WHOSE RESIDENCE UNDER THAT ROOF WAS IT IS TRUE ONLY AN INTERMITTENT ONE BUT WHOSE PRESENCE AT THE TIME OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS WHICH WILL NOW BE NARRATED BROUGHT HIS NAME PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE PUBLIC </s>
<s> THIS WAS CECIL JAMES BARKER OF HALES LODGE HAMPSTEAD </s>
<s> CECIL BARKER'S TALL LOOSEJOINTED FIGURE WAS A FAMILIAR ONE IN THE MAIN STREET OF BIRLSTONE VILLAGE FOR HE WAS A FREQUENT AND WELCOME VISITOR AT THE MANOR HOUSE </s>
<s> HE WAS THE MORE NOTICED AS BEING THE ONLY FRIEND OF THE PAST UNKNOWN LIFE OF MR. DOUGLAS WHO WAS EVER SEEN IN HIS NEW ENGLISH SURROUNDINGS </s>
<s> BARKER WAS HIMSELF AN UNDOUBTED ENGLISHMAN BUT BY HIS REMARKS IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD FIRST KNOWN DOUGLAS IN AMERICA AND HAD THERE LIVED ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH HIM </s>
<s> HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH AND WAS REPUTED TO BE A BACHELOR </s>
<s> IN AGE HE WAS RATHER YOUNGER THAN DOUGLAS FORTY FIVE AT THE MOST A TALL STRAIGHT BROAD CHESTED FELLOW WITH A CLEAN SHAVED PRIZE FIGHTER FACE THICK STRONG BLACK EYEBROWS AND A PAIR OF MASTERFUL BLACK EYES WHICH MIGHT EVEN WITHOUT THE AID OF HIS VERY CAPABLE HANDS CLEAR A WAY FOR HIM THROUGH A HOSTILE CROWD </s>
<s> HE NEITHER RODE NOR SHOT BUT SPENT HIS DAYS IN WANDERING ROUND THE OLD VILLAGE WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH OR IN DRIVING WITH HIS HOST OR IN HIS ABSENCE WITH HIS HOSTESS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE </s>
<s> AN EASY GOING FREE HANDED GENTLEMAN SAID AMES THE BUTLER </s>
<s> BUT MY WORD </s>
<s> I HAD RATHER NOT BE THE MAN THAT CROSSED HIM </s>
<s> HE WAS CORDIAL AND INTIMATE WITH DOUGLAS AND HE WAS NO LESS FRIENDLY WITH HIS WIFE A FRIENDSHIP WHICH MORE THAN ONCE SEEMED TO CAUSE SOME IRRITATION TO THE HUSBAND SO THAT EVEN THE SERVANTS WERE ABLE TO PERCEIVE HIS ANNOYANCE </s>
<s> SUCH WAS THE THIRD PERSON WHO WAS ONE OF THE FAMILY WHEN THE CATASTROPHE OCCURRED </s>
<s> AS TO THE OTHER DENIZENS OF THE OLD BUILDING IT WILL SUFFICE OUT OF A LARGE HOUSEHOLD TO MENTION THE PRIM RESPECTABLE AND CAPABLE AMES AND MRS. ALLEN A BUXOM AND CHEERFUL PERSON WHO RELIEVED THE LADY OF SOME OF HER HOUSEHOLD CARES </s>
<s> THE OTHER SIX SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT OF JANUARY SIXTH </s>
<s> IT WAS AT ELEVEN FORTY FIVE THAT THE FIRST ALARM REACHED THE SMALL LOCAL POLICE STATION IN CHARGE OF SERGEANT WILSON OF THE SUSSEX CONSTABULARY </s>
<s> CECIL BARKER MUCH EXCITED HAD RUSHED UP TO THE DOOR AND PEALED FURIOUSLY UPON THE BELL </s>
<s> A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY HAD OCCURRED AT THE MANOR HOUSE AND JOHN DOUGLAS HAD BEEN MURDERED </s>
<s> THAT WAS THE BREATHLESS BURDEN OF HIS MESSAGE </s>
<s> HE HAD HURRIED BACK TO THE HOUSE FOLLOWED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES BY THE POLICE SERGEANT WHO ARRIVED AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME A LITTLE AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK AFTER TAKING PROMPT STEPS TO WARN THE COUNTY AUTHORITIES THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS AFOOT </s>
<s> ON REACHING THE MANOR HOUSE THE SERGEANT HAD FOUND THE DRAWBRIDGE DOWN THE WINDOWS LIGHTED UP AND THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD IN A STATE OF WILD CONFUSION AND ALARM </s>
<s> THE WHITE FACED SERVANTS WERE HUDDLING TOGETHER IN THE HALL WITH THE FRIGHTENED BUTLER WRINGING HIS HANDS IN THE DOORWAY </s>
<s> ONLY CECIL BARKER SEEMED TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF AND HIS EMOTIONS HE HAD OPENED THE DOOR WHICH WAS NEAREST TO THE ENTRANCE AND HE HAD BECKONED TO THE SERGEANT TO FOLLOW HIM </s>
<s> AT THAT MOMENT THERE ARRIVED DOCTOR WOOD A BRISK AND CAPABLE GENERAL PRACTITIONER FROM THE VILLAGE </s>
<s> THE THREE MEN ENTERED THE FATAL ROOM TOGETHER WHILE THE HORRORSTRICKEN BUTLER FOLLOWED AT THEIR HEELS CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM TO SHUT OUT THE TERRIBLE SCENE FROM THE MAID SERVANTS </s>
<s> THE DEAD MAN LAY ON HIS BACK SPRAWLING WITH OUTSTRETCHED LIMBS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM </s>
<s> HE WAS CLAD ONLY IN A PINK DRESSING GOWN WHICH COVERED HIS NIGHT CLOTHES </s>
<s> THERE WERE CARPET SLIPPERS ON HIS BARE FEET </s>
<s> THE DOCTOR KNELT BESIDE HIM AND HELD DOWN THE HAND LAMP WHICH HAD STOOD ON THE TABLE </s>
<s> ONE GLANCE AT THE VICTIM WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE HEALER THAT HIS PRESENCE COULD BE DISPENSED WITH </s>
<s> THE MAN HAD BEEN HORRIBLY INJURED </s>
<s> LYING ACROSS HIS CHEST WAS A CURIOUS WEAPON A SHOTGUN WITH THE BATREL SAWED OFF A FOOT IN FRONT OF THE TRIGGERS </s>
<s> IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS HAD BEEN FIRED AT CLOSE RANGE AND THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE WHOLE CHARGE IN THE FACE BLOWING HIS HEAD ALMOST TO PIECES </s>
<s> THE TRIGGERS HAD BEEN WIRED TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE THE SIMULTANEOUS DISCHARGE MORE DESTRUCTIVE </s>
<s> THE COUNTRY POLICEMAN WAS UNNERVED AND TROUBLED BY THE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY WHICH HAD COME SO SUDDENLY UPON HIM </s>
<s> WE WILL TOUCH NOTHING UNTIL MY SUPERIORS ARRIVE HE SAID IN A HUSHED VOICE STARING IN HORROR AT THE DREADFUL HEAD </s>
<s> QUOTE NOTHING HAS BEEN TOUCHED UP TO NOW QUOTE SAID CECIL BARKER </s>
<s> I'LL ANSWER FOR THAT </s>
<s> YOU SEE IT ALL EXACTLY AS I FOUND IT </s>
<s> WHEN WAS THAT </s>
<s> THE SERGEANT HAD DRAWN OUT HIS NOTEBOOK </s>
<s> IT WAS JUST HALF PAST ELEVEN </s>
<s> I HAD NOT BEGUN TO UNDRESS AND I WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE IN MY BEDROOM WHEN I HEARD THE REPORT </s>
<s> IT WAS NOT VERY LOUD IT SEEMED TO BE MUFFLED </s>
<s> I RUSHED DOWN I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WAS THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE I WAS IN THE ROOM </s>
<s> QUOTE WAS THE DOOR OPEN QUOTE </s>
<s> YES IT WAS OPEN </s>
<s> POOR DOUGLAS WAS LYING AS YOU SEE HIM </s>
<s> HIS BEDROOM CANDLE WAS BURNING ON THE TABLE </s>
<s> IT WAS I WHO LIT THE LAMP SOME MINUTES AFTERWARD </s>
<s> DID YOU SEE NO ONE </s>
<s> NUMBER </s>
<s> I HEARD MRS. DOUGLAS COMING DOWN THE STAIR BEHIND ME AND I RUSHED OUT TO PREVENT HER FROM SEEING THIS DREADFUL SIGHT </s>
<s> MRS. ALLEN THE HOUSEKEEPER CAME AND TOOK HER AWAY </s>
<s> AMES HAD ARRIVED AND WE RAN BACK INTO THE ROOM ONCE MORE </s>
<s> QUOTE BUT SURELY I HAVE HEARD THAT THE DRAWBRIDGE IS KEPT UP ALL NIGHT SEVEN EIGHTHS </s>
<s> YES IT WAS UP UNTIL I LOWERED IT </s>
<s> THEN HOW COULD ANY MURDERER HAVE GOT AWAY </s>
<s> IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION </s>
<s> MR. DOUGLAS MUST HAVE SHOT HIMSELF </s>
<s> THAT WAS OUR FIRST IDEA </s>
<s> BUT SEE </s>
<s> BARKER DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND SHOWED THAT THE LONG DIAMOND PANED WINDOW WAS OPEN TO ITS FULL EXTENT </s>
<s> QUOTE AND LOOK AT THIS QUOTE </s>
<s> HE HELD THE LAMP DOWN AND ILLUMINATED A SMUDGE OF BLOOD LIKE THE MARK OF A BOOT SOLE U. P. N.  THE WOODEN SILL </s>
<s> SOMEONE HAS STOOD THERE IN GETTING OUT </s>
<s> YOU MEAN THAT SOMEONE WADED ACROSS THE MOAT </s>
<s> EXACTLY </s>
<s> THEN IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WITHIN HALF A MINUTE OF THE CRIME HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER AT THAT VERY MOMENT </s>
<s> I HAVE NOT A DOUBT OF IT </s>
<s> I WISH TO HEAVEN THAT I HAD RUSHED TO THE WINDOW </s>
<s> BUT THE CURTAIN SCREENED IT AS YOU CAN SEE AND SO IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME </s>
<s> THEN I HEARD THE STEP OF MRS. DOUGLAS AND I COULD NOT LET HER ENTER THE ROOM </s>
<s> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HORRIBLE QUOTE </s>
<s> HORRIBLE ENOUGH SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING AT THE SHATTERED HEAD AND THE TERRIBLE MARKS WHICH SURROUNDED IT </s>
<s> I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH INJURIES SINCE THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY SMASH </s>
<s> BUT I SAY REMARKED THE POLICE SERGEANT WHOSE SLOW BUCOLIC COMMON SENSE WAS STILL PONDERING THE OPEN WINDOW </s>
<s> IT'S ALL VERY WELL YOUR SAYING THAT A MAN ESCAPED BY WADING THIS MOAT BUT WHAT I ASK YOU IS HOW DID HE EVER GET INTO THE HOUSE AT ALL IF THE BRIDGE WAS UP </s>
<s> AH THAT'S THE QUESTION SAID BARKER </s>
<s> QUOTE AT WHAT O'CLOCK WAS IT RAISED QUOTE </s>
<s> IT WAS NEARLY SIX O'CLOCK SAID AMES THE BUTLER </s>
<s> I'VE HEARD SAID THE SERGEANT THAT IT WAS USUALLY RAISED AT SUNSET </s>
<s> THAT WOULD BE NEARER HALF PAST FOUR THAN SIX AT THIS TIME OF YEAR </s>
<s> MRS. DOUGLAS HAD VISITORS TO TEA SAID AMES </s>
<s> I COULDN'T RAISE IT UNTIL THEY WENT </s>
<s> THEN I WOUND IT UP MYSELF QUOTE </s>
<s> THEN IT COMES TO THIS SAID THE SERGEANT IF ANYONE CAME FROM OUTSIDE IF THEY DID THEY MUST HAVE GOT IN ACROSS THE BRIDGE BEFORE SIX AND BEEN IN HIDING EVER SINCE UNTIL MR. DOUGLAS CAME INTO THE ROOM AFTER ELEVEN </s>
<s> THAT IS SO </s>
<s> MR. DOUGLAS WENT ROUND THE HOUSE EVERY NIGHT THE LAST THING BEFORE HE TURNED IN TO SEE THAT THE LIGHTS WERE RIGHT </s>
<s> THAT BROUGHT HIM IN HERE </s>
<s> THE MAN WAS WAITING AND SHOT HIM </s>
<s> THEN HE GOT AWAY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LEFT HIS GUN BEHIND HIM </s>
<s> THAT'S HOW I READ IT FOR NOTHING ELSE WILL FIT THE FACTS </s>
<s> THE SERGEANT PICKED UP A CARD WHICH LAY BESIDE THE DEAD MAN ON THE FLOOR </s>
<s> THE INITIALS V. V. AND UNDER THEM THE NUMBER THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE WERE RUDELY SCRAWLED IN INK UPON IT </s>

<s> BARKER LOOKED AT IT WITH CURIOSITY </s>
<s> I NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE HE SAID </s>
<s> QUOTE THE MURDERER MUST HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND HIM QUOTE </s>
<s> V. V. THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE </s>
<s> I CAN MAKE NO SENSE OF THAT </s>
<s> THE SERGEANT KEPT TURNING IT OVER IN HIS BIG FINGERS </s>
<s> WHAT'S V. V. </s>
<s> SOMEBODY'S INITIALS MAYBE </s>
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE DOCTOR WOOD </s>
<s> IT WAS A GOOD SIZED HAMMER WHICH HAD BEEN LYING ON THE RUG IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE A SUBSTANTIAL WORKMANLIKE HAMMER </s>
<s> CECIL BARKER POINTED TO A BOX OF BRASS HEADED NAILS UPON THE MANTELPIECE </s>
<s> MR. DOUGLAS WAS ALTERING THE PICTURES YESTERDAY HE SAID </s>
<s> QUOTE I SAW HIM MYSELF STANDING UPON THAT CHAIR AND FIXING THE BIG PICTURE ABOVE IT </s>
<s> THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE HAMMER </s>
<s> WE'D BEST PUT IT BACK ON THE RUG WHERE WE FOUND IT SAID THE SERGEANT SCRATCHING HIS PUZZLED HEAD IN HIS PERPLEXITY </s>
<s> IT WILL WANT THE BEST BRAINS IN THE FORCE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING </s>
<s> IT WILL BE A LONDON JOB BEFORE IT IS FINISHED </s>
<s> HE RAISED THE HAND LAMP AND WALKED SLOWLY ROUND THE ROOM </s>
<s> HULLO HE CRIED EXCITEDLY DRAWING THE WINDOW CURTAIN TO ONE SIDE </s>
<s> QUOTE WHAT O'CLOCK WERE THOSE CURTAINS DRAWN QUOTE </s>
<s> WHEN THE LAMPS WERE LIT SAID THE BUTLER </s>
<s> IT WOULD BE SHORTLY AFTER FOUR </s>
<s> SOMEONE HAD BEEN HIDING HERE SURE ENOUGH </s>
<s> HE HELD DOWN THE LIGHT AND THE MARKS OF MUDDY BOOTS WERE VERY VISIBLE IN THE CORNER </s>
<s> I'M BOUND TO SAY THIS BEARS OUT YOUR THEORY MR. BARKER </s>
<s> IT LOOKS AS IF THE MAN GOT INTO THE HOUSE AFTER FOUR WHEN THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN AND BEFORE SIX WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS RAISED </s>
<s> HE SLIPPED INTO THIS ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST THAT HE SAW </s>
<s> THERE WAS NO OTHER PLACE WHERE HE COULD HIDE SO HE POPPED IN BEHIND THIS CURTAIN </s>
<s> THAT ALL SEEMS CLEAR ENOUGH </s>
<s> IT IS LIKELY THAT HIS MAIN IDEA WAS TO BURGLE THE HOUSE BUT MR. DOUGLAS CHANCED TO COME UPON HIM SO HE MURDERED HIM AND ESCAPED </s>
<s> QUOTE THAT'S HOW I READ IT QUOTE SAID BARKER </s>
<s> BUT I SAY AREN'T WE WASTING PRECIOUS TIME </s>
<s> COULDN'T WE START OUT AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE FELLOW GETS AWAY </s>
<s> THE SERGEANT CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT </s>
<s> THERE ARE NO TRAINS BEFORE SIX IN THE MORNING SO HE CAN'T GET AWAY BY RAIL </s>
<s> IF HE GOES BY ROAD WITH HIS LEGS ALL DRIPPING IT'S ODDS THAT SOMEONE WILL NOTICE HIM </s>
<s> ANYHOW I CAN'T LEAVE HERE MYSELF UNTIL I AM RELIEVED </s>
<s> BUT I THINK NONE OF YOU SHOULD GO UNTIL WE SEE MORE CLEARLY HOW WE ALL STAND </s>
<s> THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN THE LAMP AND WAS NARROWLY SCRUTINIZING THE BODY </s>

<s> QUOTE COULD THIS HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH THE CRIME QUOTE </s>
<s> THE DEAD MAN'S RIGHT ARM WAS THRUST OUT FROM HIS DRESSING GOWN AND EXPOSED AS HIGH AS THE ELBOW </s>
<s> ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE FOREARM WAS A CURIOUS BROWN DESIGN A TRIANGLE INSIDE A CIRCLE STANDING OUT IN VIVID RELIEF UPON THE LARD COLOURED SKIN </s>
<s> IT'S NOT TATTOOED SAID THE DOCTOR PEERING THROUGH HIS GLASSES </s>
<s> I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT </s>
<s> THE MAN HAS BEEN BRANDED AT SOME TIME AS THEY BRAND CATTLE </s>
<s> WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS </s>
<s> I DON'T PROFESS TO KNOW THE MEANING OF IT SAID CECIL BARKER BUT I HAVE SEEN THE MARK ON DOUGLAS MANY TIMES THIS LAST TEN YEARS </s>
<s> AND SO HAVE I SAID THE BUTLER </s>
<s> QUOTE MANY A TIME WHEN THE MASTER HAS ROLLED UP HIS SLEEVES I HAVE NOTICED THAT VERY MARK </s>
<s> I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE </s>
<s> THEN IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CRIME ANYHOW SAID THE SERGEANT </s>
<s> BUT IT'S A RUM THING ALL THE SAME </s>
<s> EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CASE IS RUM </s>
<s> WELL WHAT IS IT NOW </s>

<s> HE'S RIGHT SAID BARKER </s>
<s> DO YOU TELL ME SAID THE SERGEANT THAT THE WEDDING RING WAS BELOW THE OTHER </s>
<s> ALWAYS </s>
<s> QUOTE THEN THE MURDERER OR WHOEVER IT WAS FIRST TOOK OFF THIS RING YOU CALL THE NUGGET RING THEN THE WEDDING RING AND AFTERWARDS PUT THE NUGGET RING BACK AGAIN QUOTE </s>

<s> NO IT DOES NOT </s>
<s> WELL THEN EVERYONE IS AGREED THAT AFTER THE ALARM WAS GIVEN ONLY A MINUTE AT THE MOST HAD PASSED BEFORE THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD NOT MR. CECIL BARKER ALONE THOUGH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST BUT AMES AND ALL OF THEM WERE ON THE SPOT </s>

<s> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE </s>
<s> YOU PUT IT VERY CLEARLY SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> QUOTE I AM INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU QUOTE </s>
<s> WELL THEN WE ARE DRIVEN BACK TO THE THEORY THAT IT WAS DONE BY SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE </s>
<s> WE ARE STILL FACED WITH SOME BIG DIFFICULTIES BUT ANYHOW THEY HAVE CEASED TO BE IMPOSSIBILITIES </s>
<s> THE MAN GOT INTO THE HOUSE BETWEEN FOUR THIRTY AND SIX THAT IS TO SAY BETWEEN DUSK AND THE TIME WHEN THE BRIDGE WAS RAISED </s>
<s> THERE HAD BEEN SOME VISITORS AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HIM </s>
<s> HE MAY HAVE BEEN A COMMON BURGLAR OR HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME PRIVATE GRUDGE AGAINST MR. DOUGLAS </s>
<s> SINCE MR. DOUGLAS HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE IN AMERICA AND THIS SHOTGUN SEEMS TO BE AN AMERICAN WEAPON IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE PRIVATE GRUDGE IS THE MORE LIKELY THEORY </s>
<s> HE SLIPPED INTO THIS ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST HE CAME TO AND HE HID BEHIND THE CURTAIN </s>
<s> THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL PAST ELEVEN AT NIGHT </s>
<s> AT THAT TIME MR. DOUGLAS ENTERED THE ROOM </s>
<s> IT WAS A SHORT INTERVIEW IF THERE WERE ANY INTERVIEW AT ALL FOR MRS. DOUGLAS DECLARES THAT HER HUSBAND HAD NOT LEFT HER MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES WHEN SHE HEARD THE SHOT </s>
<s> THE CANDLE SHOWS THAT SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> EXACTLY </s>
<s> THE CANDLE WHICH WAS A NEW ONE IS NOT BURNED MORE THAN HALF AN INCH </s>
<s> HE MUST HAVE PLACED IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HE WAS ATTACKED OTHERWISE OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN WHEN HE FELL </s>
<s> THIS SHOWS THAT HE WAS NOT ATTACKED THE INSTANT THAT HE ENTERED THE ROOM </s>
<s> WHEN MR. BARKER ARRIVED THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND THE LAMP WAS OUT </s>

<s> HOW'S THAT MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> VERY INTERESTING BUT JUST A LITTLE UNCONVINCING </s>
<s> MAN IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE NONSENSE IF IT WASN'T THAT ANYTHING ELSE IS EVEN WORSE CRIED MACDONALD </s>
<s> SOMEBODY KILLED THE MAN AND WHOEVER IT WAS I COULD CLEARLY PROVE TO YOU THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOME OTHER WAY </s>
<s> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY ALLOWING HIS RETREAT TO BE CUT OFF LIKE THAT </s>
<s> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY USING A SHOTGUN WHEN SILENCE WAS HIS ONE CHANCE OF ESCAPE </s>
<s> COME MR. HOLMES IT'S UP TO YOU TO GIVE US A LEAD SINCE YOU SAY MR. WHITE MASON'S THEORY IS UNCONVINCING QUOTE </s>
<s> HOLMES HAD SAT INTENTLY OBSERVANT DURING THIS LONG DISCUSSION MISSING NO WORD THAT WAS SAID WITH HIS KEEN EYES DARTING TO RIGHT AND TO LEFT AND HIS FOREHEAD WRINKLED WITH SPECULATION </s>

<s> CAN YOU REMEMBER AMES WHAT MR. BARKER HAD ON HIS FEET LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU JOINED HIM IN THE STUDY </s>

<s> CHAPTER SIX A DAWNING LIGHT </s>
<s> THE THREE DETECTIVES HAD MANY MATTERS OF DETAIL INTO WHICH TO INQUIRE SO I RETURNED ALONE TO OUR MODEST QUARTERS AT THE VILLAGE INN </s>
<s> BUT BEFORE DOING SO I TOOK A STROLL IN THE CURIOUS OLD WORLD GARDEN WHICH FLANKED THE HOUSE </s>
<s> ROWS OF VERY ANCIENT YEW TREES CUT INTO STRANGE DESIGNS GIRDED IT ROUND </s>
<s> INSIDE WAS A BEAUTIFUL STRETCH OF LAWN WITH AN OLD SUNDIAL IN THE MIDDLE THE WHOLE EFFECT SO SOOTHING AND RESTFUL THAT IT WAS WELCOME TO MY SOMEWHAT JANGLED NERVES </s>
<s> IN THAT DEEPLY PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE ONE COULD FORGET OR REMEMBER ONLY AS SOME FANTASTIC NIGHTMARE THAT DARKENED STUDY WITH THE SPRAWLING BLOODSTAINED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR </s>
<s> AND YET AS I STROLLED ROUND IT AND TRIED TO STEEP MY SOUL IN ITS GENTLE BALM A STRANGE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH BROUGHT ME BACK TO THE TRAGEDY AND LEFT A SINISTER IMPRESSION IN MY MIND </s>
<s> I HAVE SAID THAT A DECORATION OF YEW TREES CIRCLED THE GARDEN </s>
<s> AT THE END FARTHEST FROM THE HOUSE THEY THICKENED INTO A CONTINUOUS HEDGE </s>
<s> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HEDGE CONCEALED FROM THE EYES OF ANYONE APPROACHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT </s>
<s> AS I APPROACHED THE SPOT I WAS AWARE OF VOICES SOME REMARK IN THE DEEP TONES OF A MAN ANSWERED BY A LITTLE RIPPLE OF FEMININE LAUGHTER </s>
<s> AN INSTANT LATER I HAD COME ROUND THE END OF THE HEDGE AND MY EYES LIT UPON MRS. DOUGLAS AND THE MAN BARKER BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE OF MY PRESENCE </s>
<s> HER APPEARANCE GAVE ME A SHOCK </s>
<s> IN THE DINING ROOM SHE HAD BEEN DEMURE AND DISCREET </s>
<s> NOW ALL PRETENSE OF GRIEF HAD PASSED AWAY FROM HER </s>
<s> HER EYES SHONE WITH THE JOY OF LIVING AND HER FACE STILL QUIVERED WITH AMUSEMENT AT SOME REMARK OF HER COMPANION </s>
<s> HE SAT FORWARD HIS HANDS CLASPED AND HIS FOREARMS ON HIS KNEES WITH AN ANSWERING SMILE UPON HIS BOLD HANDSOME FACE </s>
<s> IN AN INSTANT BUT IT WAS JUST ONE INSTANT TOO LATE THEY RESUMED THEIR SOLEMN MASKS AS MY FIGURE CAME INTO VIEW </s>

<s> ONE MOMENT DOCTOR WATSON CRIED THE WOMAN IN A PLEADING VOICE </s>
<s> THERE IS ONE QUESTION WHICH YOU CAN ANSWER WITH MORE AUTHORITY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD AND IT MAY MAKE A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE TO ME </s>
<s> YOU KNOW MR. HOLMES AND HIS RELATIONS WITH THE POLICE BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE CAN </s>
<s> SUPPOSING THAT A MATTER WERE BROUGHT CONFIDENTIALLY TO HIS KNOWLEDGE IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PASS IT ON TO THE DETECTIVES </s>

<s> I BEG I IMPLORE THAT YOU WILL DOCTOR WATSON </s>

<s> THERE WAS SUCH A RING OF SINCERITY IN THE WOMAN'S VOICE THAT FOR THE INSTANT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER LEVITY AND WAS MOVED ONLY TO DO HER WILL </s>
<s> MR. HOLMES IS AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR I SAID </s>
<s> HE IS HIS OWN MASTER AND WOULD ACT AS HIS OWN JUDGMENT DIRECTED </s>
<s> AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD NATURALLY FEEL LOYALTY TOWARDS THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE WORKING ON THE SAME CASE AND HE WOULD NOT CONCEAL FROM THEM ANYTHING WHICH WOULD HELP THEM IN BRINGING A CRIMINAL TO JUSTICE </s>
<s> BEYOND THIS I CAN SAY NOTHING AND I WOULD REFER YOU TO MR. HOLMES HIMSELF IF YOU WANTED FULLER INFORMATION </s>
<s> SO SAYING I RAISED MY HAT AND WENT UPON MY WAY LEAVING THEM STILL SEATED BEHIND THAT CONCEALING HEDGE </s>
<s> I LOOKED BACK AS I ROUNDED THE FAR END OF IT AND SAW THAT THEY WERE STILL TALKING VERY EARNESTLY TOGETHER AND AS THEY WERE GAZING AFTER ME IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS OUR INTERVIEW THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR DEBATE </s>
<s> QUOTE I WISH NONE OF THEIR CONFIDENCES QUOTE SAID HOLMES WHEN I REPORTED TO HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED </s>
<s> HE HAD SPENT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AT THE MANOR HOUSE IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS TWO COLLEAGUES AND RETURNED ABOUT FIVE WITH A RAVENOUS APPETITE FOR A HIGH TEA WHICH I HAD ORDERED FOR HIM </s>
<s> NO CONFIDENCES WATSON FOR THEY ARE MIGHTY AWKWARD IF IT COMES TO AN ARREST FOR CONSPIRACY AND MURDER </s>
<s> YOU THINK IT WILL COME TO THAT </s>

<s> MY DEAR WATSON WHEN I HAVE EXTERMINATED THAT FOURTH EGG I SHALL BE READY TO PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION </s>
<s> I DON'T SAY THAT WE HAVE FATHOMED IT FAR FROM IT BUT WHEN WE HAVE TRACED THE MISSING DUMB BELL </s>
<s> THE DUMB BELL </s>
<s> QUOTE DEAR ME WATSON IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE NOT PENETRATED THE FACT THAT THE CASE HANGS UPON THE MISSING DUMB BELL </s>
<s> WELL WELL YOU NEED NOT BE DOWNCAST FOR BETWEEN OURSELVES I DON'T THINK THAT EITHER INSPECTOR MAC OR THE EXCELLENT LOCAL PRACTITIONER HAS GRASPED THE OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE OF THIS INCIDENT </s>

<s> FINALLY HE LIT HIS PIPE AND SITTING IN THE INGLENOOK OF THE OLD VILLAGE INN HE TALKED SLOWLY AND AT RANDOM ABOUT HIS CASE RATHER AS ONE WHO THINKS ALOUD THAN AS ONE WHO MAKES A CONSIDERED STATEMENT </s>
<s> A LIE WATSON A GREAT BIG THUMPING OBTRUSIVE UNCOMPROMISING LIE THAT'S WHAT MEETS US ON THE THRESHOLD </s>

<s> THEREFORE SHE IS LYING ALSO </s>
<s> THEY ARE BOTH LYING AND IN A CONSPIRACY </s>
<s> SO NOW WE HAVE THE CLEAR PROBLEM </s>
<s> WHY ARE THEY LYING AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH WHICH THEY ARE TRYING SO HARD TO CONCEAL </s>
<s> LET US TRY WATSON YOU AND I IF WE CAN GET BEHIND THE LIE AND RECONSTRUCT THE TRUTH </s>
<s> HOW DO I KNOW THAT THEY ARE LYING </s>
<s> BECAUSE IT IS A CLUMSY FABRICATION WHICH SIMPLY COULD NOT BE TRUE </s>
<s> CONSIDER </s>
<s> ACCORDING TO THE STORY GIVEN TO US THE ASSASSIN HAD LESS THAN A MINUTE AFTER THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO TAKE THAT RING WHICH WAS UNDER ANOTHER RING FROM THE DEAD MAN'S FINGER TO REPLACE THE OTHER RING A THING WHICH HE WOULD SURELY NEVER HAVE DONE AND TO PUT THAT SINGULAR CARD BESIDE HIS VICTIM </s>
<s> I SAY THAT THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE </s>
<s> YOU MAY ARGUE BUT I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR JUDGMENT WATSON TO THINK THAT YOU WILL DO SO THAT THE RING MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN BEFORE THE MAN WAS KILLED </s>
<s> THE FACT THAT THE CANDLE HAD BEEN LIT ONLY A SHORT TIME SHOWS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LENGTHY INTERVIEW </s>
<s> WAS DOUGLAS FROM WHAT WE HEAR OF HIS FEARLESS CHARACTER A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP HIS WEDDING RING AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE OR COULD WE CONCEIVE OF HIS GIVING IT UP AT ALL </s>
<s> NO NO WATSON THE ASSASSIN WAS ALONE WITH THE DEAD MAN FOR SOME TIME WITH THE LAMP LIT </s>
<s> OF THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL </s>
<s> BUT THE GUNSHOT WAS APPARENTLY THE CAUSE OF DEATH </s>
<s> THEREFORE THE SHOT MUST HAVE BEEN FIRED SOME TIME EARLIER THAN WE ARE TOLD </s>
<s> BUT THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT SUCH A MATTER AS THAT </s>
<s> WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE THEREFORE OF A DELIBERATE CONSPIRACY UPON THE PART OF THE TWO PEOPLE WHO HEARD THE GUNSHOT OF THE MAN BARKER AND OF THE WOMAN DOUGLAS </s>
<s> WHEN ON THE TOP OF THIS I AM ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE BLOOD MARK ON THE WINDOWSILL WAS DELIBERATELY PLACED THERE BY BARKER IN ORDER TO GIVE A FALSE CLUE TO THE POLICE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THE CASE GROWS DARK AGAINST HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE NOW WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES AT WHAT HOUR THE MURDER ACTUALLY DID OCCUR </s>
<s> UP TO HALF PAST TEN THE SERVANTS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE HOUSE SO IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT BEFORE THAT TIME </s>
<s> AT A QUARTER TO ELEVEN THEY HAD ALL GONE TO THEIR ROOMS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AMES WHO WAS IN THE PANTRY </s>
<s> I HAVE BEEN TRYING SOME EXPERIMENTS AFTER YOU LEFT US THIS AFTERNOON AND I FIND THAT NO NOISE WHICH MACDONALD CAN MAKE IN THE STUDY CAN PENETRATE TO ME IN THE PANTRY WHEN THE DOORS ARE ALL SHUT </s>
<s> IT IS OTHERWISE HOWEVER FROM THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM </s>
<s> IT IS NOT SO FAR DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND FROM IT I COULD VAGUELY HEAR A VOICE WHEN IT WAS VERY LOUDLY RAISED </s>
<s> THE SOUND FROM A SHOTGUN IS TO SOME EXTENT MUFFLED WHEN THE DISCHARGE IS AT VERY CLOSE RANGE AS IT UNDOUBTEDLY WAS IN THIS INSTANCE </s>
<s> IT WOULD NOT BE VERY LOUD AND YET IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT IT SHOULD HAVE EASILY PENETRATED TO MRS. ALLEN'S ROOM </s>
<s> SHE IS AS SHE HAS TOLD US SOMEWHAT DEAF BUT NONE THE LESS SHE MENTIONED IN HER EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID HEAR SOMETHING LIKE A DOOR SLAMMING HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE ALARM WAS GIVEN </s>
<s> HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE ALARM WAS GIVEN WOULD BE A QUARTER TO ELEVEN </s>
<s> I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WHAT SHE HEARD WAS THE REPORT OF THE GUN AND THAT THIS WAS THE REAL INSTANT OF THE MURDER </s>
<s> IF THIS IS SO WE HAVE NOW TO DETERMINE WHAT BARKER AND MRS. DOUGLAS PRESUMING THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ACTUAL MURDERERS COULD HAVE BEEN DOING FROM QUARTER TO ELEVEN WHEN THE SOUND OF THE SHOT BROUGHT THEM DOWN UNTIL QUARTER PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RANG THE BELL AND SUMMONED THE SERVANTS </s>
<s> WHAT WERE THEY DOING AND WHY DID THEY NOT INSTANTLY GIVE THE ALARM </s>
<s> THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH FACES US AND WHEN IT HAS BEEN ANSWERED WE SHALL SURELY HAVE GONE SOME WAY TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM </s>
<s> I AM CONVINCED MYSELF SAID I THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THOSE TWO PEOPLE </s>
<s> SHE MUST BE A HEARTLESS CREATURE TO SIT LAUGHING AT SOME JEST WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF HER HUSBAND'S MURDER </s>
<s> QUOTE EXACTLY </s>
<s> SHE DOES NOT SHINE AS A WIFE EVEN IN HER OWN ACCOUNT OF WHAT OCCURRED </s>
<s> I AM NOT A WHOLE SOULED ADMIRER OF WOMANKIND AS YOU ARE AWARE WATSON BUT MY EXPERIENCE OF LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THERE ARE FEW WIVES HAVING ANY REGARD FOR THEIR HUSBANDS WHO WOULD LET ANY MAN'S SPOKEN WORD STAND BETWEEN THEM AND THAT HUSBAND'S DEAD BODY </s>
<s> SHOULD I EVER MARRY WATSON I SHOULD HOPE TO INSPIRE MY WIFE WITH SOME FEELING WHICH WOULD PREVENT HER FROM BEING WALKED OFF BY A HOUSEKEEPER WHEN MY CORPSE WAS LYING WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER </s>
<s> IT WAS BADLY STAGE MANAGED FOR EVEN THE RAWEST INVESTIGATORS MUST BE STRUCK BY THE ABSENCE OF THE USUAL FEMININE ULULATION </s>
<s> IF THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING ELSE THIS INCIDENT ALONE WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED A PREARRANGED CONSPIRACY TO MY MIND </s>
<s> YOU THINK THEN DEFINITELY THAT BARKER AND MRS. DOUGLAS ARE GUILTY OF THE MURDER </s>
<s> THERE IS AN APPALLING DIRECTNESS ABOUT YOUR QUESTIONS WATSON SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS PIPE AT ME </s>
<s> THEY COME AT ME LIKE BULLETS </s>
<s> IF YOU PUT IT THAT MRS. DOUGLAS AND BARKER KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MURDER AND ARE CONSPIRING TO CONCEAL IT THEN I CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE SOULED ANSWER </s>
<s> I AM SURE THEY DO </s>
<s> BUT YOUR MORE DEADLY PROPOSITION IS NOT SO CLEAR </s>
<s> LET US FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH STAND IN THE WAY </s>
<s> WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THIS COUPLE ARE UNITED BY THE BONDS OF A GUILTY LOVE AND THAT THEY HAVE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF THE MAN WHO STANDS BETWEEN THEM </s>
<s> IT IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR DISCREET INQUIRY AMONG SERVANTS AND OTHERS HAS FAILED TO CORROBORATE IT IN ANY WAY </s>
<s> ON THE CONTRARY THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF EVIDENCE THAT THE DOUGLASES WERE VERY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER QUOTE </s>
<s> THAT </s>
<s> I AM SURE. CANNOT HE TRUE. SAID I. THINKING OF THE BEAUTIFUL SMILING FACE IN THE GARDEN </s>
<s> WELL AT LEAST THCY GAVE THAT IMPRESSION </s>
<s> HOWEVER WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE AN EXTRAORDINARILY ASTUTE COUPLE WHO DECEIVE EVCRYONE UPON THIS POINT AND CONSPIRE TO MURDER THE HUSBAND </s>
<s> HE HAPPENS TO BE A MAN OVER WHOSE HEAD SOME DANGER HANGS </s>
<s> WE HAVC ONLY THEIR WORD FOR THAT </s>
<s> HOLMES LOOKED THOUGHTFUL </s>
<s> QUOTE I SEE </s>
<s> WATSON </s>
<s> YOU ARE SKETCHING OUT A THEORY BY WHICH EVERYTHING THEY SAY FROM THE BEGINNING IS FALSE </s>
<s> ACCORDING TO YOUR IDEA THERE WAS NEVER ANY HIDDEN MENACE OR SECRET SOCIETY OR VALLEY OF FEAR OR BOSS MACSOMEBODY OR ANYTHING ELSE </s>
<s> WELL THAT IS A GOOD SWEEPING GENERALIZATION </s>
<s> LET US SEE WHAT THAT BRINGS US TO </s>
<s> THEY INVENT THIS THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CRIME </s>
<s> THEY THEN PLAY UP TO THE IDEA BY LEAVING THIS BICYCLE IN THE PARK AS PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF SOME OUTSIDER </s>
<s> THE STAIN ON THE WINDOWSILL CONVEYS THE SAME IDEA </s>
<s> SO DOES THE CARD ON THE BODY WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN THE HOUSE </s>
<s> THAT ALL FITS INTO YOUR HYPOTHESIS WATSON </s>
<s> BUT NOW WE COME ON THE NASTY ANGULAR UNCOMPROMISING BITS WHICH WON'T SLIP INTO THEIR PLACES </s>
<s> WHY A CUT OFF SHOTGUN OF ALL WEAPONS AND AN AMERICAN ONE AT THAT </s>
<s> HOW COULD THEY BE SO SURE THAT THE SOUND OF IT WOULD NOT BRING SOMEONE ON TO THEM </s>
<s> IT'S A MERE CHANCE AS IT IS THAT MRS. ALLEN DID NOT START OUT TO INQUIRE FOR THE SLAMMING DOOR </s>
<s> WHY DID YOUR GUILTY COUPLE DO ALL THIS WATSON </s>
<s> I CONFESS THAT I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT </s>
<s> THEN AGAIN IF A WOMAN AND HER LOVER CONSPIRE TO MURDER A HUSBAND ARE THEY GOING TO ADVERTISE THEIR GUILT BY OSTENTATIOUSLY REMOVING HIS WEDDING RING AFTER HIS DEATH </s>
<s> DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS VERY PROBABLE WATSON </s>
<s> NO IT DOES NOT </s>
<s> QUOTE AND ONCE AGAIN IF THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING A BICYCLE CONCEALED OUTSIDE HAD OCCURRED TO YOU. WOULD IT REALLY HAVE SEEMED WORTH DOING WHEN THE DULLEST DETECTIVE WOULD NATURALLY SAY THIS IS AN OBVIOUS BLIND AS THE BICYCLE IS THE FIRST THING WHICH THE FUGITIVE NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE QUOTE </s>
<s> I CAN CONCEIVE OF NO CXPLANATION </s>
<s> AND YET THERE SHOULD BE NO COMBINATION OF CVENTS FOR WHICH THE WIT OF MAN CANNOT CONCEIVE AN EXPLANATION </s>
<s> SIMPLY AS A MENTAL EXERCISE WITHOUT ANY ASSERTION THAT IT IS TRUE </s>
<s> LET ME INDICATE A POSSIBLE LINE OF THOUGHT </s>
<s> IT IS I ADMIT MERE IMAGINATION BUT HOW OFTEN IS IMAGINATION THE MOTHER OF TRUTH </s>
<s> WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS A GUILTY SECRET A REALLY SHAMEFUL SECRET IN THE LIFE OF THIS MAN DOUGLAS </s>
<s> THIS LEADS TO HIS MURDER BY SOMEONE WHO IS. WE WILL SUPPOSE AN AVENGER SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE </s>
<s> THIS AVENGER FOR SOME REASON WHICH I CONFESS I AM STILL AT A LOSS TO CXPLAIN TOOK THE DEAD MAN'S WEDDING RING </s>
<s> THE VENDETTA MIGHT CONCEIVABLY DATE BACK TO THE MAN'S FIRST MARRIAGE AND THC RING BC TAKEN FOR SOME SUCH REASON </s>
<s> BEFORE THIS AVENGER GOT AWAY BARKER AND THE WIFE HAD REACHED THE ROOM </s>
<s> THE ASSASSIN CONVINCED THEM THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO ARREST HIM WOULD LEAD TO THE PUBLICATION OF SOME HIDEOUS SCANDAL </s>
<s> THEY WERE CONVERTED TO THIS IDEA AND PREFERRED TO LET HIM GO </s>
<s> FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY PROBABLY LOWERED THE BRIDGE WHICH CAN BE DONE QUITE NOISELESSLY AND THEN RAISED IT AGAIN </s>
<s> HE MADE HIS ESCAPE AND FOR SOME REASON THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO SO MORE SAFELY ON FOOT THAN ON THE BICYCLE </s>
<s> HE THEREFORE LEFT HIS MACHINE WHERE IT WOULD NOT BE DISCOVERED UNTIL HE HAD GOT SAFELY AWAY </s>
<s> SO FAR WE ARE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY ARE WE NOT </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL IT IS POSSIBLE NO DOUBT QUOTE SAID I WITH SOME RESERVE </s>
<s> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WATSON THAT WHATEVER OCCURRED IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY </s>
<s> WELL NOW TO CONTINUE OUR SUPPOSITITIOUS CASE THE COUPLE NOT NECESSARILY A GUILTY COUPLE REALIZE AFTER THE MURDERER IS GONE THAT THEY HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES IN A POSITION IN WHICH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PROVE THAT THEY DID NOT THEMSELVES EITHER DO THE DEED OR CONNIVE AT IT </s>
<s> THEY RAPIDLY AND RATHER CLUMSILY MET THE SITUATION </s>
<s> THE MARK WAS PUT BY BARKER'S BLOODSTAINED SLIPPER UPON THE WINDOWSILL TO SUGGEST HOW THE FUGITIVE GOT AWAY </s>
<s> THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE THE TWO WHO MUST HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE GUN SO THEY GAVE THE ALARM EXACTLY AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BUT A GOOD HALF HOUR AFTER THE EVENT </s>
<s> AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO PROVE ALL THIS </s>
<s> WELL IF THERE WERE AN OUTSIDER HE MAY BE TRACED AND TAKEN </s>
<s> THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF ALL PROOFS </s>
<s> BUT IF NOT WELL THE RESOURCES OF SCIENCE ARE FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED </s>
<s> I THINK THAT AN EVENING ALONE IN THAT STUDY WOULD HELP ME MUCH </s>
<s> QUOTE AN EVENING ALONE QUOTE </s>
<s> I PROPOSE TO GO UP THERE PRESENTLY </s>
<s> I HAVE ARRANGED IT WITH THE ESTIMABLE AMES WHO IS BY NO MEANS WHOLE HEARTED ABOUT BARKER </s>
<s> I SHALL SIT IN THAT ROOM AND SEE IF ITS ATMOSPHERE BRINGS ME INSPIRATION </s>
<s> I'M A BELIEVER IN THE GENIUS LOCI </s>
<s> YOU SMILE FRIEND WATSON </s>
<s> WELL WE SHALL SEE </s>
<s> BY THE WAY YOU HAVE THAT BIG UMBRELLA OF YOURS HAVE YOU NOT </s>
<s> IT IS HERE </s>
<s> WELL I'LL BORROW THAT IF I MAY </s>
<s> CERTAINLY BUT WHAT A WRETCHCD WEAPON </s>
<s> IF THERE IS DANGER QUOTE </s>
<s> NOTHING SERIOUS MY DEAR WATSON OR I SHOULD CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE </s>
<s> BUT I'LL TAKE THE UMBRELLA </s>
<s> AT PRESENT I AM ONLY AWAITING THE RETURN OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS WHERE THEY ARE AT PRESENT ENGAGED IN TRYING FOR A LIKELY OWNER TO THE BLCYCLE </s>
<s> IT WAS NIGHTFALL BEFORE INSPECTOR MACDONALD AND WHITE MASON CAME BACK FROM THEIR EXPEDITION AND THEY ARRIVED EXULTANT REPORTING A GREAT ADVANCE IN OUR INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> MAN I'LL ADMEET THAT I HAD MY DOUBTS IF THERE WAS EVER AN OUTSIDER SAID MACDONALD BUT THAT'S ALL PAST NOW </s>
<s> WE'VE HAD THE BICYCLE IDENTIFIED AND WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF OUR MAN SO THAT'S A LONG STEP ON OUR JOURNEY </s>
<s> IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE END SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> QUOTE I'M SURE I CONGRATULATE YOU BOTH WITH ALL MY HEART QUOTE </s>
<s> WELL I STARTED FROM THE FACT THAT MR. DOUGLAS HAD SEEMED DISTURBED SINCE THE DAY BEFORE WHEN HE HAD BEEN AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS </s>
<s> IT WAS AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS THEN THAT HE HAD BECOME CONSCIOUS OF SOME DANGER </s>
<s> IT WAS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT IF A NLAN HAD COME OVER WITH A BICYCLE IT WAS FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE COME </s>
<s> WE TOOK THE BICYCLE OVER WITH US AND SHOWED IT AT THE HOTELS </s>
<s> IT WAS IDENTIFIED AT ONCE BY THE MANAGER OF THE EAGLE COMMERCIAL AS BELONGING TO A MAN NAMED HARGRAVE WHO HAD TAKEN A ROOM THERE TWO DAYS BEFORE </s>
<s> THIS BICYCLE AND A SMALL VALISE WERE HIS WHOLE BELONGINGS </s>
<s> HE HAD REGISTERED HIS NAME AS COMING FROM LONDON BUT HAD GIVEN NO ADDRESS </s>
<s> THE VALISE WAS LONDON MADE AND THE CONTENTS WERE BRITISH BUT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS UNDOUBTEDLY AN AMERICAN </s>
<s> WELL WELL SAID HOLMES GLEEFULLY YOU HAVE INDEED DONE SOME SOLID WORK WHILE I HAVE BEEN SITTING SPINNING THEORIES WITH MY FRIEND </s>
<s> IT'S A LESSON IN BEING PRACTICAL MR. MAC </s>
<s> AY IT'S JUST THAT MR. HOLMES SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH SATISFACTION </s>
<s> QUOTE BUT THIS MAY ALL FIT IN WITH YOUR THEORIES QUOTE I REMARKED </s>
<s> THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE </s>
<s> BUT LET US HEAR THE END MR. MAC </s>
<s> WAS THERE NOTHING TO IDENTIFY THIS MAN </s>
<s> SO LITTLE THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD CAREFULLY GUARDED HIMSELF AGAINST IDENTIFICATION </s>
<s> THERE WERE NO PAPERS OR LETTERS AND NO MARKING UPON THE CLOTHES </s>
<s> A CYCLE MAP OF THE COUNTY LAY ON HIS BEDROOM TABLE </s>
<s> HE HAD LEFT THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKFAST YESTERDAY MORNING ON HIS BICYCLE AND NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM UNTIL OUR INQUIRIES </s>
<s> THAT'S WHAT PUZZLES ME MR. HOLMES SAID WHITE MASON </s>
<s> QUOTE IF THE FELLOW DID NOT WANT THE HUE AND CRY RAISED OVER HIM ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED AND REMAINED AT THE HOTEL AS AN INOFFENSIVE TOURIST </s>
<s> AS IT IS HE MUST KNOW THAT HE WILL BE REPORTED TO THE POLICE BY THE HOTEL MANAGER AND THAT HIS DISAPPEARANCE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER </s>
<s> SO ONE WOULD IMAGINE </s>
<s> STILL HE HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED OF HIS WISDOM UP TO DATE AT ANY RATE SINCE HE HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN </s>
<s> BUT HIS DESCRIPTION WHAT OF THAT </s>
<s> MACDONALD REFERRED TO HIS NOTEBOOK </s>
<s> HERE WE HAVE IT SO FAR AS THEY COULD GIVE IT </s>
<s> THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN ANY VERY PARTICULAR STOCK OF HIM BUT STILL THE PORTER THE CLERK AND THE CHAMBERMAID ARE ALL AGREED THAT THIS ABOUT COVERS THE POINTS </s>
<s> HE WAS A MAN ABOUT FIVE FOOT NINE IN HEIGHT FIFTY OR SO YEARS OF AGE HIS HAIR SLIGHTLY GRIZZLED A GRAYISH MOUSTACHE A CURVED NOSE AND A FACE WHICH ALL OF THEM DESCRIBED AS FIERCE AND FORBIDDING </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL BAR THE EXPRESSION THAT MIGHT ALMOST BE A DESCRIPTION OF DOUGLAS HIMSELF QUOTE SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> HE IS JUST OVER FIFTY WITH GRIZZLED HAIR AND MOUSTACHE AND ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT </s>
<s> DID YOU GET ANYTHING ELSE </s>
<s> HE WAS DRESSED IN A HEAVY GRAY SUIT WITH A REEFER JACKET AND HE WORE A SHORT YELLOW OVERCOAT AND A SOFT CAP </s>
<s> WHAT ABOUT THE SHOTGUN </s>
<s> IT IS LESS THAN TWO FEET LONG </s>
<s> IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE FITTED INTO HIS VALISE </s>
<s> HE COULD HAVE CARRIED IT INSIDE HIS OVERCOAT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY QUOTE </s>
<s> AND HOW DO YOU CONSIDER THAT ALL THIS BEARS UPON THE GENERAL CASE </s>
<s> WELL MR. HOLMES SAID MACDONALD WHEN WE HAVE GOT OUR MAN AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I HAD HIS DESCRIPTION ON THE WIRES WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF HEARING IT WE SHALL BE BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE </s>
<s> BUT EVEN AS IT STANDS WE HAVE SURELY GONE A LONG WAY </s>
<s> WE KNOW THAT AN AMERICAN CALLING HIMSELF HARGRAVE CAME TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS TWO DAYS AGO WITH BICYCLE AND VALISE </s>
<s> IN THE LATTER WAS A SAWED OFF SHOTGUN SO HE CAME WITH THE DELIBERATE PURPOSE OF CRIME </s>
<s> YESTERDAY MORNING HE SET OFF FOR THIS PLACE ON HIS BICYCLE WITH HIS GUN CONCEALED IN HIS OVERCOAT </s>
<s> NO ONE SAW HIM ARRIVE SO FAR AS WE CAN LEARN BUT HE NEED NOT PASS THROUGH THE VILLAGE TO REACH THE PARK GATES AND THERE ARE MANY CYCLISTS UPON THE ROAD </s>
<s> PRESUMABLY HE AT ONCE CONCEALED HIS CYCLE AMONG THE LAURELS WHERE IT WAS FOUND AND POSSIBLY LURKED THERE HIMSELF WITH HIS EYE ON THE HOUSE WAITING FOR MR. DOUGLAS TO COME OUT </s>
<s> THE SHOTGUN IS A STRANGE WEAPON TO USE INSIDE A HOUSE BUT HE HAD INTENDED TO USE IT OUTSIDE AND THERE IT HAS VERY OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES AS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS WITH IT AND THE SOUND OF SHOTS IS SO COMMON IN AN ENGLISH SPORTING NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT NO PARTICULAR NOTICE WOULD BE TAKEN </s>
<s> THAT IS ALL VERY CLEAR SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> WELL MR. DOUGLAS DID NOT APPEAR </s>
<s> WHAT WAS HE TO DO NEXT </s>
<s> HE LEFT HIS BICYCLE AND APPROACHED THE HOUSE IN THE TWILIGHT </s>
<s> HE FOUND THE BRIDGE DOWN AND NO ONE ABOUT </s>
<s> HE TOOK HIS CHANCE INTENDING NO DOUBT TO MAKE SOME EXCUSE IF HE MET ANYONE </s>
<s> HE MET NO ONE </s>
<s> HE SLIPPED INTO THE FIRST ROOM THAT HE SAW AND CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND THE CURTAIN </s>
<s> THENCE HE COULD SEE THE DRAWBRIDGE GO UP AND HE KNEW THAT HIS ONLY ESCAPE WAS THROUGH THE MOAT </s>
<s> HE WAITED UNTIL QUARTER PAST ELEVEN WHEN MR. DOUGLAS UPON HIS USUAL NIGHTLY ROUND CAME INTO THE ROOM </s>
<s> HE SHOT HIM AND ESCAPED AS ARRANGED </s>
<s> HE WAS AWARE THAT THE BICYCLE WOULD BE DESCRIBED BY THE HOTEL PEOPLE AND BE A CLUE AGAINST HIM SO HE LEFT IT THERE AND MADE HIS WAY BY SOME OTHER MEANS TO LONDON OR TO SOME SAFE HIDING PLACE WHICH HE HAD ALREADY ARRANGED </s>
<s> HOW IS THAT MR. HOLMES QUOTE </s>
<s> WELL MR. MAC IT IS VERY GOOD AND VERY CLEAR SO FAR AS IT GOES </s>
<s> THAT IS YOUR END OF THE STORY </s>
<s> MY END IS THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN REPORTED THAT MRS. DOUGLAS AND BARKER ARE BOTH IN A CONSPIRACY TO CONCEAL SOMETHING THAT THEY AIDED THE MURDERER'S ESCAPE OR AT LEAST THAT THEY REACHED THE ROOM BEFORE HE ESCAPED AND THAT THEY FABRICATED EVIDENCE OF HIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE WINDOW WHEREAS IN ALL PROBABILITY THEY HAD THEMSELVES LET HIM GO BY LOWERING THE BRIDGE </s>
<s> THAT'S MY READING OF THE FIRST HALF </s>
<s> THE TWO DETECTIVES SHOOK THEIR HEADS </s>
<s> WELL MR. HOLMES IF THIS IS TRUE WE ONLY TUMBLE OUT OF ONE MYSTERY INTO ANOTHER SAID THE LONDON INSPECTOR </s>
<s> AND IN SOME WAYS A WORSE ONE ADDED WHITE MASON </s>
<s> THE LADY HAS NEVER BEEN IN AMERICA IN ALL HER LIFE </s>
<s> WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION COULD SHE HAVE WITH AN AMERICAN ASSASSIN WHICH WOULD CAUSE HER TO SHELTER HIM QUOTE </s>
<s> I FREELY ADMIT THE DIFFICULTIES SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> I PROPOSE TO MAKE A LITTLE INVESTIGATION OF MY OWN TO NIGHT AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE COMMON CAUSE </s>
<s> CAN WE HELP YOU MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> NO NO </s>
<s> DARKNESS AND DOCTOR WATSON'S UMBRELLA MY WANTS ARE SIMPLE </s>
<s> AND AMES THE FAITHFUL AMES NO DOUBT HE WILL STRETCH A POINT FOR ME </s>
<s> ALL MY LINES OF THOUGHT LEAD ME BACK INVARIABLY TO THE ONE BASIC QUESTION WHY SHOULD AN ATHLETIC MAN DEVELOP HIS FRAME UPON SO UNNATURAL AN INSTRUMENT AS A SINGLE DUMB BELL </s>
<s> IT WAS LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN HOLMES RETURNED FROM HIS SOLITARY EXCURSION </s>
<s> WE SLEPT IN A DOUBLE BEDDED ROOM WHICH WAS THE BEST THAT THE LITTLE COUNTRY INN COULD DO FOR US </s>
<s> I WAS ALREADY ASLEEP WHEN I WAS PARTLY AWAKENED BY HIS ENTRANCE </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL HOLMES QUOTE I MURMURED QUOTE HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING OUT QUOTE </s>
<s> HE STOOD BESIDE ME IN SILENCE HIS CANDLE IN HIS HAND </s>
<s> THEN THE TALL LEAN FIGURE INCLINED TOWARDS ME </s>
<s> I SAY WATSON HE WHISPERED WOULD YOU BE AFRAID TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM WITH A LUNATIC A MAN WITH SOFTENING OF THE BRAIN AN IDIOT WHOSE MIND HAS LOST ITS GRIP </s>
<s> NOT IN THE LEAST I ANSWERED IN ASTONISHMENT </s>
<s> AH THAT'S LUCKY HE SAID AND NOT ANOTHER WORD WOULD HE UTTER THAT NIGHT </s>
<s> CHAPTER SEVEN THE SOLUTION </s>
<s> NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST WE FOUND INSPECTOR MACDONALD AND WHITE MASON SEATED IN CLOSE CONSULTATION IN THE SMALL PARLOUR OF THE LOCAL POLICE SERGEANT </s>
<s> ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THEM WERE PILED A NUMBER OF LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS WHICH THEY WERE CAREFULLY SORTING AND DOCKETING </s>
<s> THREE HAD BEEN PLACED ON ONE SIDE </s>
<s> STILL ON THE TRACK OF THE ELUSIVE BICYCLIST </s>
<s> HOLMES ASKED CHEERFULLY </s>
<s> WHAT IS THE LATEST NEWS OF THE RUFFIAN </s>
<s> MACDONALD POINTED RUEFULLY TO HIS HEAP OF CORRESPONDENCE </s>
<s> QUOTE HE IS AT PRESENT REPORTED FROM LEICESTER NOTTINGHAM SOUTHAMPTON DERBY EAST HAM RICHMOND AND FOURTEEN OTHER PLACES </s>
<s> IN THREE OF THEM EAST HAM LEICESTER AND LIVERPOOL THERE IS A CLEAR CASE AGAINST HIM AND HE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED </s>
<s> THE COUNTRY SEEMS TO BE FULL OF THE FUGITIVES WITH YELLOW COATS </s>
<s> DEAR ME SAID HOLMES SYMPATHETICALLY </s>
<s> NOW MR. MAC AND YOU MR. WHITE MASON I WISH TO GIVE YOU A VERY EARNEST PIECE OF ADVICE </s>
<s> WHEN I WENT INTO THIS CASE WITH YOU I BARGAINED AS YOU WILL NO DOUBT REMEMBER THAT I SHOULD NOT PRESENT YOU WITH HALF PROVED THEORIES BUT THAT I SHOULD RETAIN AND WORK OUT MY OWN IDEAS UNTIL I HAD SATISFIED MYSELF THAT THEY WERE CORRECT </s>
<s> FOR THIS REASON I AM NOT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TELLING YOU ALL THAT IS IN MY MIND </s>
<s> ON THE OTHER HAND I SAID THAT I WOULD PLAY THE GAME FAIRLY BY YOU AND I DO NOT THINK IT IS A FAIR GAME TO ALLOW YOU FOR ONE UNNECESSARY MOMENT TO WASTE YOUR ENERGIES UPON A PROFITLESS TASK </s>
<s> THEREFORE I AM HERE TO ADVISE YOU THIS MORNING AND MY ADVICE TO YOU IS SUMMED UP IN THREE WORDS ABANDON THE CASE </s>
<s> MACDONALD AND WHITE MASON STARED IN AMAZEMENT AT THEIR CELEBRATED COLLEAGUE </s>
<s> YOU CONSIDER IT HOPELESS CRIED THE INSPECTOR </s>
<s> QUOTE I CONSIDER YOUR CASE TO BE HOPELESS </s>
<s> I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT IT IS HOPELESS TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH </s>
<s> BUT THIS CYCLIST </s>
<s> HE IS NOT AN INVENTION </s>
<s> WE HAVE HIS DESCRIPTION HIS VALISE HIS BICYCLE </s>
<s> THE FELLOW MUST BE SOMEWHERE </s>
<s> WHY SHOULD WE NOT GET HIM </s>
<s> YES YES NO DOUBT HE IS SOMEWHERE AND NO DOUBT WE SHALL GET HIM BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU WASTE YOUR ENERGIES IN EAST HAM OR LIVERPOOL </s>
<s> I AM SURE THAT WE CAN FIND SOME SHORTER CUT TO A RESULT </s>
<s> QUOTE YOU ARE HOLDING SOMETHING BACK </s>
<s> IT'S HARDLY FAIR OF YOU MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> THE INSPECTOR WAS ANNOYED </s>
<s> YOU KNOW MY METHODS OF WORK MR. MAC </s>
<s> BUT I WILL HOLD IT BACK FOR THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE </s>
<s> I ONLY WISH TO VERIFY MY DETAILS IN ONE WAY WHICH CAN VERY READILY BE DONE AND THEN I MAKE MY BOW AND RETURN TO LONDON LEAVING MY RESULTS ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE </s>
<s> I OWE YOU TOO MUCH TO ACT OTHERWISE FOR IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE I CANNOT RECALL ANY MORE SINGULAR AND INTERESTING STUDY </s>
<s> THIS IS CLEAN BEYOND ME MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> WE SAW YOU WHEN WE RETURNED FROM TUNBNDGE WELLS LAST NIGHT AND YOU WERE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH OUR RESULTS </s>
<s> WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN TO GIVE YOU A COMPLETELY NEW IDEA OF THE CASE </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL SINCE YOU ASK ME I SPENT AS I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD SOME HOURS LAST NIGHT AT THE MANOR HOUSE QUOTE </s>
<s> WELL WHAT HAPPENED </s>
<s> AH I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A VERY GENERAL ANSWER TO THAT FOR THE MOMENT </s>
<s> BY THE WAY I HAVE BEEN READING A SHORT BUT CLEAR AND INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE OLD BUILDING PURCHASABLE AT THE MODEST SUM OF ONE PENNY FROM THE LOCAL TOBACCONIST </s>
<s> HERE HOLMES DREW A SMALL TRACT EMBELLISHED WITH A RUDE ENGRAVING OF THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET </s>
<s> IT IMMENSELY ADDS TO THE ZEST OF AN INVESTIGATION MY DEAR MR. MAC WHEN ONE IS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH THE HISTORICAL ATMOSPHERE OF ONE'S SURROUNDINGS </s>
<s> DON'T LOOK SO IMPATIENT FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN SO BALD AN ACCOUNT AS THIS RAISES SOME SORT OF PICTURE OF THE PAST IN ONE'S MIND </s>
<s> PERMIT ME TO GIVE YOU A SAMPLE </s>
<s> ERECTED IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF JAMES ONE AND STANDING UPON THE SITE OF A MUCH OLDER BUILDING THE MANOR HOUSE OF BIRLSTONE PRESENTS ONE OF THE FINEST SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF THE MOATED JACOBEAN RESIDENCE </s>
<s> QUOTE YOU ARE MAKING FOOLS OF US MR. HOLMES QUOTE </s>
<s> TUT TUT MR. MAC THE FIRST SIGN OF TEMPER I HAVE DETECTED IN YOU </s>
<s> WELL I WON'T READ IT VERBATIM SINCE YOU FEEL SO STRONGLY UPON THE SUBJECT </s>
<s> BUT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THERE IS SOME ACCOUNT OF THE TAKING OF THE PLACE BY A PARLIAMENTARY COLONEL IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY FOUR OF THE CONCEALMENT OF CHARLES FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE COURSE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND FINALLY OF A VISIT THERE BY THE SECOND GEORGE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS OF INTEREST CONNECTED WITH THIS ANCIENT HOUSE </s>
<s> I DON'T DOUBT IT MR. HOLMES BUT THAT IS NO BUSINESS OF OURS </s>
<s> IS IT NOT </s>
<s> IS IT NOT </s>
<s> BREADTH OF VIEW MY DEAR MR. MAC IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIALS OF OUR PROFESSION </s>
<s> THE INTERPLAY OF IDEAS AND THE OBLIQUE USES OF KNOWLEDGE ARE OFTEN OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST </s>
<s> YOU WILL EXCUSE THESE REMARKS FROM ONE WHO THOUGH A MERE CONNOISSEUR OF CRIME IS STILL RATHER OLDER AND PERHAPS MORE EXPERIENCED THAN YOURSELF </s>
<s> QUOTE I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT QUOTE SAID THE DETECTIVE HEARTILY </s>
<s> YOU GET TO YOUR POINT I ADMIT BUT YOU HAVE SUCH A DEUCED ROUND THECORNER WAY OF DOING IT </s>
<s> WELL WELL I'LL DROP PAST HISTORY AND GET DOWN TO PRESENTDAY FACTS </s>
<s> I CALLED LAST NIGHT AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID AT THE MANOR HOUSE </s>
<s> I DID NOT SEE EITHER BARKER OR MRS. DOUGLAS </s>
<s> I SAW NO NECESSITY TO DISTURB THEM BUT I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE LADY WAS NOT VISIBLY PINING AND THAT SHE HAD PARTAKEN OF AN EXCELLENT DINNER </s>
<s> MY VISIT WAS SPECIALLY MADE TO THE GOOD MR. AMES WITH WHOM I EXCHANGED SOME AMIABILITIES WHICH CULMINATED IN HIS ALLOWING ME WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANYONE ELSE. TO SIT ALONE FOR A TIME IN THE STUDY </s>
<s> WHAT </s>
<s> WITH THAT </s>
<s> I EJACULATED </s>
<s> QUOTE NO NO EVERYTHING IS NOW IN ORDER </s>
<s> YOU GAVE PERMISSION FOR THAT MR. MAC AS I AM INFORMED </s>
<s> THE ROOM WAS IN ITS NORMAL STATE AND IN IT I PASSED AN INSTRUCTIVE QUARTER OF AN HOUR </s>
<s> WHAT WERE YOU DOING </s>
<s> WELL NOT TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF SO SIMPLE A MATTER I WAS LOOKING FOR THE MISSING DUMB BELL </s>
<s> IT HAS ALWAYS BULKED RATHER LARGE IN MY ESTIMATE OF THE CASE </s>
<s> I ENDED BY FINDING IT </s>
<s> WHERE </s>
<s> QUOTE AH THERE WE COME TO THE EDGE OF THE UNEXPLORED </s>
<s> LET ME GO A LITTLE FURTHER A VERY LITTLE FURTHER AND I WILL PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL SHARE EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW </s>
<s> WELL WE'RE BOUND TO TAKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS SAID THE INSPECTOR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING US TO ABANDON THE CASE WHY IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS SHOULD WE ABANDON THE CASE </s>
<s> FOR THE SIMPLE REASON MY DEAR MR. MAC THAT YOU HAVE NOT GOT THE FIRST IDEA WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE INVESTIGATING </s>
<s> WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF MR. JOHN DOUGLAS OF BIRLSTONE MANOR </s>
<s> YES YES SO YOU ARE </s>
<s> BUT DON'T TROUBLE TO TRACE THE MYSTERIOUS GENTLEMAN UPON THE BICYCLE </s>
<s> I ASSURE YOU THAT IT WON'T HELP YOU QUOTE </s>
<s> THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE DO </s>
<s> I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL DO IT </s>
<s> WELL I'M BOUND TO SAY I'VE ALWAYS FOUND YOU HAD REASON BEHIND ALL YOUR QUEER WAYS </s>
<s> I'LL DO WHAT YOU ADVISE </s>
<s> AND YOU MR. WHITE MASON </s>

<s> HOLMES AND HIS METHODS WERE NEW TO HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE INSPECTOR IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME QUOTE HE SAID AT LAST </s>
<s> CAPITAL SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> WELL THEN I SHOULD RECOMMEND A NICE CHEERY COUNTRY WALK FOR BOTH OF YOU </s>
<s> THEY TELL ME THAT THE VIEWS FROM BIRLSTONE RIDGE OVER THE WEALD ARE VERY REMARKABLE </s>
<s> NO DOUBT LUNCH COULD BE GOT AT SOME SUITABLE HOSTELRY THOUGH MY IGNORANCE OF THE COUNTRY PREVENTS ME FROM RECOMMENDING ONE </s>
<s> IN THE EVENING TIRED BUT HAPPY </s>
<s> MAN THIS IS GETTING PAST A JOKE CRIED MACDONALD RISING ANGRILY FROM HIS CHAIR </s>
<s> WELL WELL SPEND THE DAY AS YOU LIKE SAID HOLMES PATTING HIM CHEERFULLY UPON THE SHOULDER </s>
<s> QUOTE DO WHAT YOU LIKE AND GO WHERE YOU WILL BUT MEET ME HERE BEFORE DUSK WITHOUT FAIL WITHOUT FAIL MR. MAC QUOTE </s>
<s> THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE SANITY </s>
<s> ALL OF IT WAS EXCELLENT ADVICE BUT I DON'T INSIST SO LONG AS YOU ARE HERE WHEN I NEED YOU </s>
<s> BUT NOW BEFORE WE PART I WANT YOU TO WRITE A NOTE TO MR. BARKER </s>
<s> WELL </s>
<s> I'LL DICTATE IT IF YOU LIKE </s>

<s> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE SAID THE INSPECTOR </s>
<s> I'VE MADE INQUIRY </s>
<s> TUT TUT </s>
<s> MY DEAR SIR PLEASE DO WHAT I ASK YOU </s>
<s> WELL GO ON. IN THE HOPE THAT WE MAY FIND SOMETHING WHICH MAY BEAR UPON OUR INVESTIGATION </s>
<s> I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE WORKMEN WILL BE AT WORK EARLY TO MORROW MORNING DIVERT ING THE STREAM QUOTE </s>
<s> IMPOSSIBLE DIVERTING THE STREAM SO I THOUGHT IT BEST TO EXPLAIN MATTERS BEFOREHAND </s>
<s> NOW SIGN THAT AND SEND IT BY HAND ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK </s>
<s> AT THAT HOUR WE SHALL MEET AGAIN IN THIS ROOM </s>
<s> UNTIL THEN WE MAY EACH DO WHAT WE LIKE FOR I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS INQUIRY HAS COME TO A DEFINITE PAUSE </s>
<s> EVENING WAS DRAWING IN WHEN WE REASSEMBLED </s>
<s> HOLMES WAS VERY SERIOUS IN HIS MANNER MYSELF CURIOUS AND THE DETECTIVES OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL AND ANNOYED </s>
<s> WELL GENTLEMEN SAID MY FRIEND GRAVELY I AM ASKING YOU NOW TO PUT EVERYTHING TO THE TEST WITH ME AND YOU WILL JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES WHETHER THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH I HAVE COME </s>
<s> IT IS A CHILL EVENING AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG OUR EXPEDITION MAY LAST SO I BEG THAT YOU WILL WEAR YOUR WARMEST COATS </s>
<s> IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT WE SHOULD BE IN OUR PLACES BEFORE IT GROWS DARK SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION WE SHALL GET STARTED AT ONCE </s>
<s> WE PASSED ALONG THE OUTER BOUNDS OF THE MANOR HOUSE PARK UNTIL WE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A GAP IN THE RAILS WHICH FENCED IT </s>
<s> THROUGH THIS WE SLIPPED AND THEN IN THE GATHERING GLOOM WE FOLLOWED HOLMES UNTIL WE HAD REACHED A SHRUBBERY WHICH LIES NEARLY OPPOSITE TO THE MAIN DOOR AND THE DRAWBRIDGE </s>
<s> THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN RAISED </s>
<s> HOLMES CROUCHED DOWN BEHIND THE SCREEN OF LAURELS AND WE ALL THREE FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE </s>
<s> WELL WHAT ARE WE TO DO NOW ASKED MACDONALD WITH SOME GRUFFNESS </s>
<s> QUOTE POSSESS OUR SOULS IN PATIENCE AND MAKE AS LITTLE NOISE AS POSSIBLE QUOTE HOLMES ANSWERED </s>
<s> WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR AT ALL </s>
<s> I REALLY THINK THAT YOU MIGHT TREAT US WITH MORE FRANKNESS </s>
<s> HOLMES LAUGHED </s>
<s> WATSON INSISTS THAT I AM THE DRAMATIST IN REAL LIFE SAID HE </s>
<s> SOME TOUCH OF THE ARTIST WELLS UP WITHIN ME AND CALLS INSISTENTLY FOR A WELL STAGED PERFORMANCE </s>
<s> SURELY OUR PROFESSION MR. MAC WOULD BE A DRAB AND SORDID ONE IF WE DID NOT SOMETIMES SET THE SCENE SO AS TO GLORIFY OUR RESULTS </s>
<s> THE BLUNT ACCUSATION THE BRUTAL TAP UPON THE SHOULDER WHAT CAN ONE MAKE OF SUCH A DENOUEMENT </s>
<s> BUT THE QUICK INFERENCE THE SUBTLE TRAP THE CLEVER FORECAST OF COMING EVENTS THE TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION OF BOLD THEORIES ARE THESE NOT THE PRIDE AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF OUR LIFE'S WORK </s>
<s> AT THE PRESENT MOMENT YOU THRILL WITH THE GLAMOUR OF THE SITUATION AND THE ANTICIPATION OF THE HUNT </s>
<s> WHERE WOULD BE THAT THRILL IF I HAD BEEN AS DEFINITE AS A TIMETABLE </s>
<s> I ONLY ASK A LITTLE PATIENCE MR. MAC AND ALL WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL I HOPE THE PRIDE AND JUSTIFICATION AND THE REST OF IT WILL COME BEFORE WE ALL GET OUR DEATH OF COLD QUOTE SAID THE LONDON DETECTIVE WITH COMIC RESIGNATION </s>
<s> WE ALL HAD GOOD REASON TO JOIN IN THE ASPIRATION FOR OUR VIGIL WAS A LONG AND BITTER ONE </s>
<s> SLOWLY THE SHADOWS DARKENED OVER THE LONG SOMBRE FACE OF THE OLD HOUSE </s>
<s> A COLD DAMP REEK FROM THE MOAT CHILLED US TO THE BONES AND SET OUR TEETH CHATTERING </s>
<s> THERE WAS A SINGLE LAMP OVER THE GATEWAY AND A STEADY GLOBE OF LIGHT IN THE FATAL STUDY </s>
<s> EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DARK AND STILL </s>
<s> HOW LONG IS THIS TO LAST ASKED THE INSPECTOR FINALLY </s>
<s> AND WHAT IS IT WE ARE WATCHING FOR </s>
<s> I HAVE NO MORE NOTION THAN YOU HOW LONG IT IS TO LAST HOLMES ANSWERED WITH SOME ASPERITY </s>
<s> IF CRIMINALS WOULD ALWAYS SCHEDULE THEIR MOVEMENTS LIKE RAILWAY TRAINS IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR ALL OF US </s>
<s> AS TO WHAT IT IS WE WELL THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WATCHING FOR </s>
<s> AS HE SPOKE THE BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT IN THE STUDY WAS OBSCURED BY SOMEBODY PASSING TO AND FRO BEFORE IT </s>
<s> THE LAURELS AMONG WHICH WE LAY WERE IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE WINDOW AND NOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM IT </s>
<s> PRESENTLY IT WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A WHINING OF HINGES AND WE COULD DIMLY SEE THE DARK OUTLINE OF A MAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS LOOKING OUT INTO THE GLOOM </s>
<s> FOR SOME MINUTES HE PEERED FORTH IN FURTIVE STEALTHY FASHION AS ONE WHO WISHES TO BE ASSURED THAT HE IS UNOBSERVED </s>
<s> THEN HE LEANED FORWARD AND IN THE INTENSE SILENCE WE WERE AWARE OF THE SOFT LAPPING OF AGITATED WATER </s>
<s> HE SEEMED TO BE STIRRING UP THE MOAT WITH SOMETHING WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND </s>
<s> THEN SUDDENLY HE HAULED SOMETHING IN AS A FISHERMAN LANDS A FISH SOME LARGE ROUND OBJECT WHICH OBSCURED THE LIGHT AS IT WAS DRAGGED THROUGH THE OPEN CASEMENT </s>
<s> QUOTE NOW QUOTE CRIED HOLMES </s>
<s> NOW </s>
<s> WE WERE ALL UPON OUR FEET STAGGERING AFTER HIM WITH OUR STIFFENED LIMBS WHILE HE RAN SWIFTLY ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND RANG VIOLENTLY AT THE BELL </s>
<s> THERE WAS THE RASPING OF BOLTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND THE AMAZED AMES STOOD IN THE ENTRANCE </s>
<s> HOLMES BRUSHED HIM ASIDE WITHOUT A WORD AND FOLLOWED BY ALL OF US RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE MAN WHOM WE HAD BEEN WATCHING </s>
<s> THE OIL LAMP ON THE TABLE REPRESENTED THE GLOW WHICH WE HAD SEEN FROM OUTSIDE </s>

<s> WHAT THE DEVIL IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS HE CRIED </s>
<s> WHAT ARE YOU AFTER ANYHOW </s>
<s> HOLMES TOOK A SWIFT GLANCE ROUND AND THEN POUNCED UPON A SODDEN BUNDLE TIED TOGETHER WITH CORD WHICH LAY WHERE IT HAD BEEN THRUST UNDER THE WRITING TABLE </s>
<s> THIS IS WHAT WE ARE AFTER MR. BARKER THIS BUNDLE WEIGHTED WITH A DUMB BELL WHICH YOU HAVE JUST RAISED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE MOAT </s>
<s> BARKER STARED AT HOLMES WITH AMAZEMENT IN HIS FACE </s>
<s> HOW IN THUNDER CAME YOU TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE ASKED </s>
<s> QUOTE SIMPLY THAT I PUT IT THERE QUOTE </s>
<s> YOU PUT IT THERE </s>
<s> YOU </s>
<s> PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE SAID REPLACED IT THERE SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> YOU WILL REMEMBER INSPECTOR MACDONALD THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT STRUCK BY THE ABSENCE OF A DUMB BELL </s>
<s> I DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO IT BUT WITH THE PRESSURE OF OTHER EVENTS YOU HAD HARDLY THE TIME TO GIVE IT THE CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED YOU TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS FROM IT </s>
<s> WHEN WATER IS NEAR AND A WEIGHT IS MISSING IT IS NOT A VERY FAR FETCHED SUPPOSITION THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN SUNK IN THE WATER </s>
<s> THE IDEA WAS AT LEAST WORTH TESTING SO WITH THE HELP OF AMES WHO ADMITTED ME TO THE ROOM AND THE CROOK OF DOCTOR WATSON'S UMBRELLA I WAS ABLE LAST NIGHT TO FISH UP AND INSPECT THIS BUNDLE </s>
<s> IT WAS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE HOWEVER THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE WHO PLACED IT THERE </s>
<s> THIS WE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE VERY OBVIOUS DEVICE OF ANNOUNCING THAT THE MOAT WOULD BE DRIED TO MORROW WHICH HAD OF COURSE THE EFFECT THAT WHOEVER HAD HIDDEN THE BUNDLE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY WITHDRAW IT THE MOMENT THAT DARKNESS ENABLED HIM TO DO SO </s>
<s> WE HAVE NO LESS THAN FOUR WITNESSES AS TO WHO IT WAS WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND SO MR. BARKER I THINK THE WORD LIES NOW WITH YOU QUOTE </s>

<s> THEREFORE I HAD TO DETERMINE WHERE MR.

<s> I NEVER EXPLAINED TO MY WIFE HOW THINGS WERE </s>
<s> WHY SHOULD I PULL HER INTO IT </s>
<s> SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE A QUIET MOMENT AGAIN BUT WOULD ALWAYS BE IMAGINING TROUBLE </s>

<s> I GUESS WHEN A MAN HAS HAD DANGERS IN HIS LIFE AND I'VE HAD MORE THAN MOST IN MY TIME THERE IS A KIND OF SIXTH SENSE THAT WAVES THE RED FLAG </s>
<s> I SAW THE SIGNAL CLEAR ENOUGH AND YET I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHY </s>

<s> I'D JUST THE ONE CANDLE THAT WAS IN MY HAND BUT THERE WAS A GOOD LIGHT FROM THE HALL LAMP THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR </s>
<s> I PUT DOWN THE CANDLE AND JUMPED FOR A HAMMER THAT I'D LEFT ON THE MANTEL </s>
<s> AT THE SAME MOMENT HE SPRANG AT ME </s>

<s> I'M USED TO ROUGH WORK BUT I FAIRLY TURNED SICK AT THE SIGHT OF HIM </s>
<s> I WAS HANGING ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE WHEN BARKER CAME HURRYING DOWN </s>
<s> I HEARD MY WIFE COMING AND I RAN TO THE DOOR AND STOPPED HER </s>
<s> IT WAS NO SIGHT FOR A WOMAN </s>
<s> I PROMISED I'D COME TO HER SOON </s>
<s> I SAID A WORD OR TWO TO BARKER HE TOOK IT ALL IN AT A GLANCE AND WE WAITED FOR THE REST TO COME ALONG </s>
<s> BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM </s>
<s> THEN WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY COULD HEAR NOTHING AND THAT ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED WAS KNOWN ONLY TO OURSELVES </s>
<s> QUOTE IT WAS AT THAT INSTANT THAT THE IDEA CAME TO ME </s>
<s> I WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED BY THE BRILLIANCE OF IT </s>
<s> THE MAN'S SLEEVE HAD SLIPPED UP AND THERE WAS THE BRANDED MARK OF THE LODGE UPON HIS FOREARM </s>
<s> SEE HERE </s>
<s> THE MAN WHOM WE HAD KNOWN AS DOUGLAS TURNED UP HIS OWN COAT AND CUFF TO SHOW A BROWN TRIANGLE WITHIN A CIRCLE EXACTLY LIKE THAT WHICH WE HAD SEEN UPON THE DEAD MAN </s>
<s> IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THAT WHICH STARTED ME ON IT </s>
<s> I SEEMED TO SEE IT ALL CLEAR AT A GLANCE </s>
<s> THERE WERE HIS HEIGHT AND HAIR AND FIGURE ABOUT THE SAME AS MY OWN </s>
<s> NO ONE COULD SWEAR TO HIS FACE POOR DEVIL </s>
<s> I BROUGHT DOWN THIS SUIT OF CLOTHES AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BARKER AND I HAD PUT MY DRESSING GOWN ON HIM AND HE LAY AS YOU FOUND HIM </s>
<s> WE TIED ALL HIS THINGS INTO A BUNDLE AND I WEIGHTED THEM WITH THE ONLY WEIGHT I COULD FIND AND PUT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW </s>
<s> THE CARD HE HAD MEANT TO LAY UPON MY BODY WAS LYING BESIDE HIS OWN </s>

<s> I DON'T KNOW ANYHOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE CARED TO PART WITH IT BUT IF I HAD WANTED TO I COULDN'T </s>
<s> SO WE JUST HAD TO LEAVE THAT DETAIL TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF </s>

<s> WELL THAT WAS THE SITUATION </s>
<s> IF I COULD LIE LOW FOR A WHILE AND THEN GET AWAY WHERE I COULD BE JOINED BY MY WIDOW WE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE AT LAST OF LIVING IN PEACE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES </s>
<s> THESE DEVILS WOULD GIVE ME NO REST SO LONG AS I WAS ABOVE GROUND BUT IF THEY SAW IN THE PAPERS THAT BALDWIN HAD GOT HIS MAN THERE WOULD BE AN END OF ALL MY TROUBLES </s>
<s> I HADN'T MUCH TIME TO MAKE IT ALL CLEAR TO BARKER AND TO MY WIFE BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO HELP ME </s>
<s> I KNEW ALL ABOUT THIS HIDING PLACE SO DID AMES BUT IT NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD TO CONNECT IT WITH THE MATTER </s>
<s> I RETIRED INTO IT AND IT WAS UP TO BARKER TO DO THE REST </s>

<s> IT WAS A TALL ORDER THAT BUT AS THE BRIDGE WAS UP THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY </s>
<s> THEN WHEN EVERYTHING WAS FIXED HE RANG THE BELL FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH </s>
<s> WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARD YOU KNOW </s>
<s> AND SO GENTLEMEN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU PLEASE BUT I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH AND THE WHOLE TRUTH SO HELP ME GOD </s>
<s> WHAT I ASK YOU NOW IS HOW DO I STAND BY THE ENGLISH LAW QUOTE </s>
<s> THERE WAS A SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY SHERLOCK HOLMES </s>

<s> THE STEAM PLOUGHS HAD HOWEVER KEPT THE RAILROAD OPEN AND THE EVENING TRAIN WHICH CONNECTS THE LONG LINE OF COAL MINING AND IRON WORKING SETTLEMENTS WAS SLOWLY GROANING ITS WAY UP THE STEEP GRADIENTS WHICH LEAD FROM STAGVILLE ON THE PLAIN TO VERMISSA THE CENTRAL TOWNSHIP WHICH LIES AT THE HEAD OF VERMISSA VALLEY </s>
<s> FROM THIS POINT THE TRACK SWEEPS DOWNWARD TO BARTONS CROSSING HELMDALE AND THE PURELY AGRICULTURAL COUNTY OF MERTON </s>
<s> IT WAS A SINGLE TRACK RAILROAD BUT AT EVERY SIDING AND THEY WERE NUMEROUS LONG LINES OF TRUCKS PILED WITH COAL AND IRON ORE TOLD OF THE HIDDEN WEALTH WHICH HAD BROUGHT A RUDE POPULATION AND A BUSTLING LIFE TO THIS MOST DESOLATE CORNER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </s>
<s> FOR DESOLATE IT WAS </s>
<s> LITTLE COULD THE FIRST PIONEER WHO HAD TRAVERSED IT HAVE EVER IMAGINED THAT THE FAIREST PRAIRIES AND THE MOST LUSH WATER PASTURES WERE VALUELESS COMPARED TO THIS GLOOMY LAND OF BLACK CRAG AND TANGLED FOREST </s>
<s> ABOVE THE DARK AND OFTEN SCARCELY PENETRABLE WOODS UPON THEIR FLANKS THE HIGH BARE CROWNS OF THE MOUNTAINS WHITE SNOW AND JAGGED ROCK TOWERED UPON EACH FLANK LEAVING A LONG WINDING TORTUOUS VALLEY IN THE CENTRE </s>
<s> UP THIS THE LITTLE TRAIN WAS SLOWLY CRAWLING </s>
<s> THE OIL LAMPS HAD JUST BEEN LIT IN THE LEADING PASSENGER CAR A LONG BARE CARRIAGE IN WHICH SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE WERE SEATED </s>

<s> AND YET THE MAN WHO STUDIED HIM MORE CLOSELY MIGHT DISCERN A CERTAIN FIRMNESS OF JAW AND GRIM TIGHTNESS ABOUT THE LIPS WHICH WOULD WARN HIM THAT THERE WERE DEPTHS BEYOND AND THAT THIS PLEASANT BROWN HAIRED YOUNG IRISHMAN MIGHT CONCEIVABLY LEAVE HIS MARK FOR GOOD OR EVIL UPON ANY SOCIETY TO WHICH HE WAS INTRODUCED </s>
<s> HAVING MADE ONE OR TWO TENTATIVE REMARKS TO THE NEAREST MINER AND RECEIVING ONLY SHORT GRUFF REPLIES THE TRAVELLER RESIGNED HIMSELF TO UNCONGENIAL SILENCE STARING MOODILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE FADING LANDSCAPE </s>
<s> IT WAS NOT A CHEERING PROSPECT </s>

<s> THE YOUNG TRAVELLER GAZED OUT INTO THIS DISMAL COUNTRY WITH A FACE OF MINGLED REPULSION AND INTEREST WHICH SHOWED THAT THE SCENE WAS NEW TO HIM </s>

<s> I DON'T SEE BROTHER MORRIS SAID THE CHAIRMAN THAT IT MATTERS TO US WHO BUYS THEM SINCE THEY CAN'T CARRY THEM OUT OF THE DISTRICT </s>
<s> WITH ALL RESPECT TO YOU EMINENT BODYMASTER I THINK IT MAY MATTER VERY MUCH TO US </s>
<s> THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON NOW FOR TEN LONG YEARS </s>
<s> WE ARE GRADUALLY DRIVING ALL THE SMALL MEN OUT OF TRADE </s>
<s> WHAT IS THE RESULT </s>
<s> WE FIND IN THEIR PLACES GREAT COMPANIES LIKE THE RAILROAD OR THE GENERAL IRON WHO HAVE THEIR DIRECTORS IN NEW YORK OR PHILADELPHIA AND CARE NOTHING FOR OUR THREATS </s>
<s> WE CAN TAKE IT OUT OF THEIR LOCAL BOSSES BUT IT ONLY MEANS THAT OTHERS WILL BE SENT IN THEIR STEAD </s>
<s> AND WE ARE MAKING IT DANGEROUS FOR OURSELVES </s>
<s> THE SMALL MEN COULD NOT HARM US </s>
<s> THEY HAD NOT THE MONEY NOR THE POWER </s>

<s> SURE COUNCILLOR I AM LITTLE MORE THAN A RECRUIT SAID MCMURDO BUT HIS FACE SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE GREAT MAN'S COMPLIMENT </s>
<s> WHEN HE HAD RETURNED HOME HE MADE HIS OWN PREPARATIONS FOR THE GRIM EVENING IN FRONT OF HIM </s>
