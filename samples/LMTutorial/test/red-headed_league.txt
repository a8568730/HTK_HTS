<s> I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES ONE DAY IN THE AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR AND FOUND HIM IN DEEP CONVERSATION WITH A VERY STOUT FLORID FACED ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH FIERY RED HAIR </s>
<s> WITH AN APOLOGY FOR MY INTRUSION I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HOLMES PULLED ME ABRUPTLY INTO THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME </s>
<s> QUOTE YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME MY DEAR WATSON QUOTE HE SAID CORDIALLY </s>
<s> I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED </s>
<s> SO I AM </s>
<s> VERY MUCH SO </s>
<s> THEN I CAN WAIT IN THE NEXT ROOM </s>
<s> NOT AT ALL </s>
<s> THIS GENTLEMAN MR. WILSON HAS BEEN MY PARTNER AND HELPER IN MANY OF MY MOST SUCCESSFUL CASES AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL BE OF THE UTMOST USE TO ME IN YOURS ALSO QUOTE </s>
<s> THE STOUT GENTLEMAN HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GAVE A BOB OF GREETING WITH A QUICK LITTLE QUESTIONING GLANCE FROM HIS SMALL FAT ENCIRCLED EYES </s>
<s> TRY THE SETTEE SAID HOLMES RELAPSING INTO HIS ARMCHAIR AND PUTTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AS WAS HIS CUSTOM WHEN IN JUDICIAL MOODS </s>
<s> I KNOW MY DEAR WATSON THAT YOU SHARE MY LOVE OF ALL THAT IS BIZARRE AND OUTSIDE THE CONVENTIONS AND HUMDRUM ROUTINE OF EVERYDAY LIFE </s>
<s> YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR RELISH FOR IT BY THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH HAS PROMPTED YOU TO CHRONICLE AND IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO SOMEWHAT TO EMBELLISH SO MANY OF MY OWN LITTLE ADVENTURES </s>
<s> YOUR CASES HAVE INDEED BEEN OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO ME I OBSERVED </s>
<s> YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT I REMARKED THE OTHER DAY JUST BEFORE WE WENT INTO THE VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM PRESENTED BY MISS MARY SUTHERLAND THAT FOR STRANGE EFFECTS AND EXTRAORDINARY COMBINATIONS WE MUST GO TO LIFE ITSELF WHICH IS ALWAYS FAR MORE DARING THAN ANY EFFORT OF THE IMAGINATION </s>

<s> YOU DID DOCTOR BUT NONE THE LESS YOU MUST COME ROUND TO MY VIEW FOR OTHERWISE I SHALL KEEP ON PILING FACT UPON FACT ON YOU UNTIL YOUR REASON BREAKS DOWN UNDER THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES ME TO BE RIGHT </s>
<s> NOW MR. JABEZ WILSON HERE HAS BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL UPON ME THIS MORNING AND TO BEGIN A NARRATIVE WHICH PROMISES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR WHICH I HAVE LISTENED TO FOR SOME TIME </s>
<s> YOU HAVE HEARD ME REMARK THAT THE STRANGEST AND MOST UNIQUE THINGS ARE VERY OFTEN CONNECTED NOT WITH THE LARGER BUT WITH THE SMALLER CRIMES AND OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR DOUBT WHETHER ANY POSITIVE CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED </s>
<s> AS FAR AS I HAVE HEARD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHETHER THE PRESENT CASE IS AN INSTANCE OF CRIME OR NOT BUT THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS CERTAINLY AMONG THE MOST SINGULAR THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO </s>
<s> PERHAPS MR. WILSON YOU WOULD HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO RECOMMENCE YOUR NARRATIVE </s>
<s> I ASK YOU NOT MERELY BECAUSE MY FRIEND DOCTOR WATSON HAS NOT HEARD THE OPENING PART BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE STORY MAKES ME ANXIOUS TO HAVE EVERY POSSIBLE DETAIL FROM YOUR LIPS </s>

<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES'S QUICK EYE TOOK IN MY OCCUPATION AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE AS HE NOTICED MY QUESTIONING GLANCES </s>
<s> BEYOND THE OBVIOUS FACTS THAT HE HAS AT SOME TIME DONE MANUAL LABOUR THAT HE TAKES SNUFF THAT HE IS A FREEMASON THAT HE HAS BEEN IN CHINA AND THAT HE HAS DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WRITING LATELY I CAN DEDUCE NOTHING ELSE </s>
<s> MR. JABEZ WILSON STARTED UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS FOREFINGER UPON THE PAPER BUT HIS EYES UPON MY COMPANION </s>
<s> HOW IN THE NAME OF GOOD FORTUNE DID YOU KNOW ALL THAT MR. HOLMES HE ASKED </s>

<s> YOU HAVE WORKED WITH IT AND THE MUSCLES ARE MORE DEVELOPED </s>
<s> WELL THE SNUFF THEN AND THE FREEMASONRY </s>
<s> I WON'T INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE BY TELLING YOU HOW I READ THAT ESPECIALLY AS RATHER AGAINST THE STRICT RULES OF YOUR ORDER YOU USE AN ARC AND COMPASS BREASTPIN </s>
<s> AH OF COURSE I FORGOT THAT </s>
<s> BUT THE WRITING QUOTE </s>
<s> WHAT ELSE CAN BE INDICATED BY THAT RIGHT CUFF SO VERY SHINY FOR FIVE INCHES AND THE LEFT ONE WITH THE SMOOTH PATCH NEAR THE ELBOW WHERE YOU REST IT UPON THE DESK </s>
<s> WELL BUT CHINA </s>
<s> THE FISH THAT YOU HAVE TATTOOED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE YOUR RIGHT WRIST COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE IN CHINA </s>
<s> I HAVE MADE A SMALL STUDY OF TATTOO MARKS AND HAVE EVEN CONTRIBUTED TO THE LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT </s>
<s> THAT TRICK OF STAINING THE FISHES' SCALES OF A DELICATE PINK IS QUITE PECULIAR TO CHINA </s>
<s> WHEN IN ADDITION I SEE A CHINESE COIN HANGING FROM YOUR WATCH CHAIN THE MATTER BECOMES EVEN MORE SIMPLE </s>
<s> MR. JABEZ WILSON LAUGHED HEAVILY </s>
<s> WELL I NEVER SAID HE </s>

<s> I USED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TWO ASSISTANTS BUT NOW I ONLY KEEP ONE AND I WOULD HAVE A JOB TO PAY HIM BUT THAT HE IS WILLING TO COME FOR HALF WAGES SO AS TO LEARN THE BUSINESS </s>
<s> WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS OBLIGING YOUTH ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES </s>
<s> HIS NAME IS VINCENT SPAULDING AND HE'S NOT SUCH A YOUTH EITHER </s>
<s> IT'S HARD TO SAY HIS AGE </s>
<s> I SHOULD NOT WISH A SMARTER ASSISTANT MR. HOLMES AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT HE COULD BETTER HIMSELF AND EARN TWICE WHAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE HIM </s>
<s> BUT AFTER ALL IF HE IS SATISFIED WHY SHOULD I PUT IDEAS IN HIS HEAD QUOTE </s>
<s> WHY INDEED </s>
<s> YOU SEEM MOST FORTUNATE IN HAVING AN EMPLOYEE WHO COMES UNDER THE FULL MARKET PRICE </s>
<s> IT IS NOT A COMMON EXPERIENCE AMONG EMPLOYERS IN THIS AGE </s>
<s> I DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR ASSISTANT IS NOT AS REMARKABLE AS YOUR ADVERTISEMENT </s>
<s> OH HE HAS HIS FAULTS TOO SAID MR. WILSON </s>
<s> NEVER WAS SUCH A FELLOW FOR PHOTOGRAPHY </s>
<s> SNAPPING AWAY WITH A CAMERA WHEN HE OUGHT TO BE IMPROVING HIS MIND AND THEN DIVING DOWN INTO THE CELLAR LIKE A RABBIT INTO ITS HOLE TO DEVELOP HIS PICTURES </s>
<s> THAT IS HIS MAIN FAULT BUT ON THE WHOLE HE'S A GOOD WORKER </s>
<s> THERE'S NO VICE IN HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE HE IS STILL WITH YOU I PRESUME QUOTE </s>

<s> THE FIRST THING THAT PUT US OUT WAS THAT ADVERTISEMENT </s>
<s> SPAULDING HE CAME DOWN INTO THE OFFICE JUST THIS DAY EIGHT WEEKS WITH THIS VERY PAPER IN HIS HAND AND HE SAYS </s>
<s> I WISH TO THE LORD MR. WILSON THAT I WAS A RED HEADED MAN </s>
<s> WHY THAT </s>
<s> I ASKS </s>
<s> WHY SAYS HE HERE'S ANOTHER VACANCY ON THE LEAGUE OF THE RED HEADED MEN </s>
<s> IT'S WORTH QUITE A LITTLE FORTUNE TO ANY MAN WHO GETS IT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MORE VACANCIES THAN THERE ARE MEN SO THAT THE TRUSTEES ARE AT THEIR WITS' END WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY </s>
<s> IF MY HAIR WOULD ONLY CHANGE COLOUR HERE'S A NICE LITTLE CRIB ALL READY FOR ME TO STEP INTO </s>
<s> QUOTE WHY WHAT IS IT THEN </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> YOU SEE </s>
<s> MR. HOLMES I AM A VERY STAY AT HOME MAN AND AS MY BUSINESS CAME TO ME INSTEAD OF MY HAVING TO GO TO IT I WAS OFTEN WEEKS ON END WITHOUT PUTTING MY FOOT OVER THE DOOR MAT </s>
<s> IN THAT WAY I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH OF WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE AND I WAS ALWAYS GLAD OF A BIT OF NEWS </s>
<s> HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE LEAGUE OF THE RED HEADED MEN HE ASKED WITH HIS EYES OPEN </s>
<s> NEVER </s>
<s> WHY WONDER AT THAT FOR YOU ARE ELIGIBILE YOURSELF FOR ONE OF THE VACANCIES </s>
<s> AND WHAT ARE THEY WORTH </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> OH MERELY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED A YEAR BUT THE WORK IS SLIGHT AND IT NEED NOT INTERFERE VERY MUCH WITH ONE'S OTHER OCCUPATIONS </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL YOU CAN EASILY THINK THAT THAT MADE ME PRICK UP MY EARS FOR THE BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN OVER GOOD FOR SOME YEARS AND AN EXTRA COUPLE OF HUNDRED WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HANDY </s>
<s> TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SAID I </s>
<s> WELL SAID HE. SHOWING ME THE ADVERTISEMENT YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT THE LEAGUE HAS A VACANCY AND THERE IS THE ADDRESS WHERE YOU SHOULD APPLY FOR PARTICULARS </s>
<s> AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT THE LEAGUE WAS FOUNDED BY AN AMERICAN MILLIONAIRE </s>
<s> EZEKIAH HOPKINS WHO WAS VERY PECULIAR IN HIS WAYS </s>
<s> HE WAS HIMSELF RED HEADED AND HE HAD A GREAT SYMPATHY FOR ALL REDHEADED MEN SO WHEN HE DIED IT WAS FOUND THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS ENORMOUS FORTUNE IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO APPLY THE INTEREST TO THE PROVIDING OF EASY BERTHS TO MEN WHOSE HAIR IS OF THAT COLOUR </s>
<s> FROM ALL I HEAR IT IS SPLENDID PAY AND VERY LITTLE TO DO </s>
<s> BUT SAID I THERE WOULD BE MILLIONS OF RED HEADED MEN WHO WOULD APPLY </s>
<s> NOT SO MANY AS YOU MIGHT THINK HE ANSWERED </s>
<s> YOU SEE IT IS REALLY CONFINED TO LONDONERS AND TO GROWN MEN </s>
<s> THIS AMERICAN HAD STARTED FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE WANTED TO DO THE OLD TOWN A GOOD TURN </s>
<s> THEN AGAIN I HAVE HEARD IT IS NO USE YOUR APPLYING IF YOUR HAIR IS LIGHT RED OR DARK RED OR ANYTHING BUT REAL BRIGHT BLAZING FIERY RED </s>
<s> NOW IF YOU CARED TO APPLY MR. WILSON YOU WOULD JUST WALK IN BUT PERHAPS IT WOULD HARDLY BE WORTH YOUR WHILE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS </s>
<s> NOW IT IS A FACT GENTLEMEN AS YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT MY HAIR IS OF A VERY FULL AND RICH TINT SO THAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF THERE WAS TO BE ANY COMPETITION IN THE MATTER I STOOD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANY MAN THAT I HAD EVER MET </s>
<s> VINCENT SPAULDING SEEMED TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THAT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT PROVE USEFUL SO I JUST ORDERED HIM TO PUT UP THE SHUTTERS FOR THE DAY AND TO COME RIGHT AWAY WITH ME </s>
<s> HE WAS VERY WILLING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY SO WE SHUT THE BUSINESS UP AND STARTED OFF FOR THE ADDRESS THAT WAS GIVEN US IN THE ADVERTISEMENT </s>
<s> QUOTE I NEVER HOPE TO SEE SUCH A SIGHT AS THAT AGAIN MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> FROM NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST EVERY MAN WHO HAD A SHADE OF RED IN HIS HAIR HAD TRAMPED INTO THE CITY TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENT </s>
<s> FLEET STREET WAS CHOKED WITH RED HEADED FOLK AND POPE'S COURT LOOKED LIKE A COSTER'S ORANGE BARROW </s>
<s> I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THERE WERE SO MANY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THAT SINGLE ADVERTISEMENT </s>
<s> EVERY SHADE OF COLOUR THEY WERE STRAW LEMON ORANGE BRICK IRISH SETTER LIVER CLAY BUT AS SPAULDING SAID THERE WERE NOT MANY WHO HAD THE REAL VIVID FLAME COLOURED TINT </s>
<s> WHEN I SAW HOW MANY WERE WAITING I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT UP IN DESPAIR BUT SPAULDING WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT </s>
<s> HOW HE DID IT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HE PUSHED AND PULLED AND BUTTED UNTIL HE GOT ME THROUGH THE CROWD AND RIGHT UP TO THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE OFFICE </s>
<s> THERE WAS A DOUBLE STREAM UPON THE STAIR SOME GOING UP IN HOPE AND SOME COMING BACK DEJECTED BUT WE WEDGED IN AS WELL AS WE COULD AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES IN THE OFFICE </s>
<s> YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A MOST ENTERTAINING ONE REMARKED HOLMES AS HIS CLIENT PAUSED AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY WITH A HUGE PINCH OF SNUFF </s>
<s> PRAY CONTINUE YOUR VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT </s>
<s> THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE OFFICE BUT A COUPLE OF WOODEN CHAIRS AND A DEAL TABLE BEHIND WHICH SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A HEAD THAT WAS EVEN REDDER THAN MINE </s>
<s> HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO EACH CANDIDATE AS HE CAME UP AND THEN HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO FIND SOME FAULT IN THEM WHICH WOULD DISQUALIFY THEM </s>
<s> GETTING A VACANCY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SUCH A VERY EASY MATTER AFTER ALL </s>
<s> HOWEVER WHEN OUR TURN CAME THE LITTLE MAN WAS MUCH MORE FAVOURABLE TO ME THAN TO ANY OF THE OTHERS AND HE CLOSED THE DOOR AS WE ENTERED SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE WORD WITH US </s>
<s> THIS IS MR. JABEZ WILSON SAID MY ASSISTANT AND HE IS WILLING TO FILL A VACANCY IN THE LEAGUE </s>
<s> QUOTE AND HE IS ADMIRABLY SUITED FOR IT THE OTHER ANSWERED </s>
<s> HE HAS EVERY REQUIREMENT </s>
<s> I CANNOT RECALL WHEN I HAVE SEEN ANYTHING SO FINE </s>
<s> HE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND GAZED AT MY HAIR UNTIL I FELT QUITE BASHFUL </s>
<s> THEN SUDDENLY HE PLUNGED FORWARD WRUNG MY HAND AND CONGRATULATED ME WARMLY ON MY SUCCESS </s>
<s> IT WOULD BE INJUSTICE TO HESITATE SAID HE </s>
<s> YOU WILL HOWEVER I AM SURE EXCUSE ME FOR TAKING AN OBVIOUS PRECAUTION </s>
<s> WITH THAT HE SEIZED MY HAIR IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND TUGGED UNTIL I YELLED WITH THE PAIN </s>
<s> THERE IS WATER IN YOUR EYES SAID HE AS HE RELEASED ME </s>
<s> I PERCEIVE THAT ALL IS AS IT SHOULD BE </s>
<s> BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL FOR WE HAVE TWICE BEEN DECEIVED BY WIGS AND ONCE BY PAINT </s>
<s> I COULD TELL YOU TALES OF COBBLER'S WAX WHICH WOULD DISGUST YOU WITH HUMAN NATURE </s>
<s> HE STEPPED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND SHOUTED THROUGH IT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE THAT THE VACANCY WAS FILLED </s>
<s> A GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT CAME UP FROM BELOW AND THE FOLK ALL TROOPED AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS UNTIL THERE WAS NOT A RED HEAD TO BE SEEN EXCEPT MY OWN AND THAT OF THE MANAGER </s>
<s> MY NAME SAID HE IS MR. DUNCAN ROSS AND I AM MYSELF ONE OF THE PENSIONERS UPON THE FUND LEFT BY OUR NOBLE BENEFACTOR </s>
<s> ARE YOU A MARRIED MAN MR. WILSON </s>
<s> HAVE YOU A FAMILY </s>
<s> I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NOT </s>
<s> HIS FACE FELL IMMEDIATELY </s>
<s> DEAR ME HE SAID GRAVELY THAT IS VERY SERIOUS INDEED </s>
<s> I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT </s>
<s> THE FUND WAS OF COURSE FOR THE PROPAGATION AND SPREAD OF THE RED HEADS AS WELL AS FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE </s>
<s> IT IS EXCEEDINGLY UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE A BACHELOR </s>
<s> QUOTE MY FACE LENGTHENED AT THIS MR. HOLMES FOR I THOUGHT THAT I WAS NOT TO HAVE THE VACANCY AFTER ALL BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER FOR A FEW MINUTES HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT </s>
<s> IN THE CASE OF ANOTHER SAID HE THE OBJECTION MIGHT BE FATAL BUT WE MUST STRETCH A POINT IN FAVOUR OF A MAN WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR AS YOURS </s>
<s> WHEN SHALL YOU BE ABLE TO ENTER UPON YOUR NEW DUTIES </s>
<s> WELL IT IS A LITTLE AWKWARD FOR I HAVE A BUSINESS ALREADY SAID I </s>
<s> OH NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT MR. WILSON SAID VINCENT SPAULDING </s>

<s> WHAT WOULD BE THE HOURS </s>
<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> TEN TO TWO </s>
<s> QUOTE NOW A PAWNBROKER'S BUSINESS IS MOSTLY DONE OF AN EVENING MR. HOLMES ESPECIALLY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING WHICH IS JUST BEFORE PAY DAY SO IT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL TO EARN A LITTLE IN THE MORNINGS </s>
<s> BESIDES I KNEW THAT MY ASSISTANT WAS A GOOD MAN AND THAT HE WOULD SEE TO ANYTHING THAT TURNED UP </s>
<s> THAT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL SAID I. AND THE PAY </s>
<s> IS FOUR POUNDS A WEEK </s>
<s> AND THE WORK </s>
<s> IS PURELY NOMINAL </s>
<s> WHAT DO YOU CALL PURELY NOMINAL </s>
<s> QUOTE WELL YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE OFFICE OR AT LEAST IN THE BUILDING THE WHOLE TIME </s>
<s> IF YOU LEAVE YOU FORFEIT YOUR WHOLE POSITION FOREVER </s>
<s> THE WILL IS VERY CLEAR UPON THAT POINT </s>

<s> HE BOWED ME OUT OF THE ROOM AND I WENT HOME WITH MY ASSISTANT HARDLY KNOWING WHAT TO SAY OR DO I WAS SO PLEASED AT MY OWN GOOD FORTUNE </s>
<s> WELL I THOUGHT OVER THE MATTER ALL DAY AND BY EVENING I WAS IN LOW SPIRITS AGAIN FOR I HAD QUITE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT THE WHOLE AFFAIR MUST BE SOME GREAT HOAX OR FRAUD THOUGH WHAT ITS OBJECT MIGHT BE I COULD NOT IMAGINE </s>

<s> AT TWO O'CLOCK HE BADE ME GOOD DAY COMPLIMENTED ME UPON THE AMOUNT THAT I HAD WRITTEN AND LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE OFFICE AFTER ME </s>
<s> THIS WENT ON DAY AFTER DAY MR. HOLMES AND ON SATURDAY THE MANAGER CAME IN AND PLANKED DOWN FOUR GOLDEN SOVEREIGNS FOR MY WEEK'S WORK </s>

<s> I STARTED OFF MR. HOLMES BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT ADDRESS IT WAS A MANUFACTORY OF ARTIFICIAL KNEE CAPS AND NO ONE IN IT HAD EVER HEARD OF EITHER MR. WILLIAM MORRIS OR MR. DUNCAN ROSS </s>
<s> AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN ASKED HOLMES </s>
<s> I WENT HOME TO SAXE COBURG SQUARE AND I TOOK THE ADVICE OF MY ASSISTANT </s>
<s> BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY </s>
<s> HE COULD ONLY SAY THAT IF I WAITED I SHOULD HEAR BY POST </s>
<s> BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH MR. HOLMES </s>
<s> I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE SUCH A PLACE WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SO AS I HAD HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ADVICE TO POOR FOLK WHO WERE IN NEED OF IT I CAME RIGHT AWAY TO YOU QUOTE </s>

<s> FINALLY HE RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKER'S AND HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED </s>
<s> IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A BRIGHT LOOKING CLEAN SHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP IN </s>
<s> THANK YOU SAID HOLMES I ONLY WISHED TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD GO FROM HERE TO THE STRAND </s>
<s> THIRD RIGHT FOURTH LEFT ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT PROMPTLY CLOSING THE DOOR </s>
<s> QUOTE SMART FELLOW THAT QUOTE OBSERVED HOLMES AS WE WALKED AWAY </s>
<s> HE IS IN MY JUDGMENT THE FOURTH SMARTEST MAN IN LONDON AND FOR DARING I AM NOT SURE THAT HE HAS NOT A CLAIM TO BE THIRD </s>
<s> I HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING OF HIM BEFORE </s>
<s> EVIDENTLY SAID I MR. WILSON'S ASSISTANT COUNTS FOR A GOOD DEAL IN THIS MYSTERY OF THE RED HEADED LEAGUE </s>
<s> I AM SURE THAT YOU INQUIRED YOUR WAY MERELY IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HIM </s>
<s> NOT HIM </s>
<s> QUOTE WHAT THEN QUOTE </s>

<s> AND WHAT DID YOU SEE </s>
<s> WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE </s>
<s> WHY DID YOU BEAT THE PAVEMENT </s>
<s> MY DEAR DOCTOR THIS IS A TIME FOR OBSERVATION NOT FOR TALK </s>
<s> WE ARE SPIES IN AN ENEMY'S COUNTRY </s>
<s> WE KNOW SOMETHING OF SAXE COBURG SQUARE </s>
<s> LET US NOW EXPLORE THE PARTS WHICH LIE BEHIND IT QUOTE </s>
<s> THE ROAD IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AS WE TURNED ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE RETIRED SAXE COBURG SQUARE PRESENTED AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO IT AS THE FRONT OF A PICTURE DOES TO THE BACK </s>
<s> IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES WHICH CONVEYED THE TRAFFIC OF THE CITY TO THE NORTH AND WEST </s>
<s> THE ROADWAY WAS BLOCKED WITH THE IMMENSE STREAM OF COMMERCE FLOWING IN A DOUBLE TIDE INWARD AND OUTWARD WHILE THE FOOTPATHS WERE BLACK WITH THE HURRYING SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS </s>
<s> IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALIZE AS WE LOOKED AT THE LINE OF FINE SHOPS AND STATELY BUSINESS PREMISES THAT THEY REALLY ABUTTED ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THE FADED AND STAGNANT SQUARE WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED </s>
<s> LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES STANDING AT THE CORNER AND GLANCING ALONG THE LINE I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THE HOUSES HERE </s>
<s> IT IS A HOBBY OF MINE TO HAVE AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON </s>
<s> THERE IS MORTIMER'S THE TOBACCONIST THE LITTLE NEWSPAPER SHOP THE COBURG BRANCH OF THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK THE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT AND MCFARLANE'S CARRIAGE BUILDING DEPOT </s>
<s> THAT CARRIES US RIGHT ON TO THE OTHER BLOCK </s>
<s> AND NOW DOCTOR WE'VE DONE OUR WORK SO IT'S TIME WE HAD SOME PLAY </s>
<s> A SANDWICH AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN OFF TO VIOLIN LAND WHERE ALL IS SWEETNESS AND DELICACY AND HARMONY AND THERE ARE NO RED HEADED CLIENTS TO VEX US WITH THEIR CONUNDRUMS </s>
<s> MY FRIEND WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICIAN BEING HIMSELF NOT ONLY A VERY CAPABLE PERFOMER BUT A COMPOSER OF NO ORDINARY MERIT </s>
<s> ALL THE AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS WRAPPED IN THE MOST PERFECT HAPPINESS GENTLY WAVING HIS LONG THIN FINGERS IN TIME TO THE MUSIC WHILE HIS GENTLY SMILING FACE AND HIS LANGUID DREAMY EYES WERE AS UNLIKE THOSE OF HOLMES THE SLEUTH HOUND HOLMES THE RELENTLESS KEEN WITTED READY HANDED CRIMINAL AGENT AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE </s>
<s> IN HIS SINGULAR CHARACTER THE DUAL NATURE ALTERNATELY ASSERTED ITSELF AND HIS EXTREME EXACTNESS AND ASTUTENESS REPRESENTED AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THE REACTION AGAINST THE POETIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD WHICH OCCASIONALLY PREDOMINATED IN HIM </s>
<s> THE SWING OF HIS NATURE TOOK HIM FROM EXTREME LANGUOR TO DEVOURING ENERGY AND AS I KNEW WELL HE WAS NEVER SO TRULY FORMIDABLE AS WHEN FOR DAYS ON END HE HAD BEEN LOUNGING IN HIS ARMCHAIR AMID HIS IMPROVISATIONS AND HIS BLACK LETTER EDITIONS </s>
<s> THEN IT WAS THAT THE LUST OF THE CHASE WOULD SUDDENLY COME UPON HIM AND THAT HIS BRILLIANT REASONING POWER WOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF INTUITION UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH HIS METHODS WOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AS ON A MAN WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT THAT OF OTHER MORTALS </s>
<s> WHEN I SAW HIM THAT AFTERNOON SO ENWRAPPED IN THE MUSIC AT SAINT JAMES'S HALL I FELT THAT AN EVIL TIME MIGHT BE COMING UPON THOSE WHOM HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN </s>
<s> YOU WANT TO GO HOME NO DOUBT DOCTOR HE REMARKED AS WE EMERGED </s>
<s> YES IT WOULD BE AS WELL </s>
<s> AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO DO WHICH WILL TAKE SOME HOURS </s>
<s> THIS BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE IS SERIOUS QUOTE </s>
<s> WHY SERIOUS </s>
<s> A CONSIDERABLE CRIME IS IN CONTEMPLATION </s>
<s> I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL BE IN TIME TO STOP IT </s>
<s> BUT TO DAY BEING SATURDAY RATHER COMPLICATES MATTERS </s>
<s> I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP TO NIGHT </s>
<s> AT WHAT TIME </s>
<s> TEN WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH </s>
<s> QUOTE I SHALL BE AT BAKER STREET AT TEN QUOTE </s>
<s> VERY WELL </s>
<s> AND I SAY DOCTOR THERE MAY BE SOME LITTLE DANGER SO KINDLY PUT YOUR ARMY REVOLVER IN YOUR POCKET </s>
<s> HE WAVED HIS HAND TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE CROWD </s>
<s> I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS BUT I WAS ALWAYS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES </s>
<s> HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD I HAD SEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SAW CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND GROTESQUE </s>
<s> AS I DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT OVER IT ALL FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE RED HEADED COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXE COBURG SQUARE AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME </s>
<s> WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION AND WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED </s>
<s> WHERE WERE WE GOING AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO </s>
<s> I HAD THE HINT FROM HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTH FACED PAWNBROKER'S ASSISTANT WAS A FORMIDABLE MAN A MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME </s>
<s> I TRIED TO PUZZLE IT OUT BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER ASIDE UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION </s>
<s> IT WAS A QUARTER PAST NINE WHEN I STARTED FROM HOME AND MADE MY WAY ACROSS THE PARK AND SO THROUGH OXFORD STREET TO BAKER STREET </s>
<s> TWO HANSOMS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR AND AS I ENTERED THE PASSAGE I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM ABOVE </s>
<s> ON ENTERING HIS ROOM I FOUND HOLMES IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM I RECOGNIZED AS PETER JONES THE OFFICIAL POLICE AGENT WHILE THE OTHER WAS A LONG THIN SAD FACED MAN WITH A VERY SHINY HAT AND OPPRESSIVELY RESPECTABLE FROCK COAT </s>
<s> HA </s>
<s> OUR PARTY IS COMPLETE SAID HOLMES BUTTONING UP HIS PEAJACKET AND TAKING HIS HEAVY HUNTING CROP FROM THE RACK </s>
<s> WATSON I THINK YOU KNOW MR. JONES OF SCOTLAND YARD </s>
<s> LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MR. MERRYWEATHER WHO IS TO BE OUR COMPANION IN TO NIGHT'S ADVENTURE QUOTE </s>
<s> WE'RE HUNTING IN COUPLES AGAIN DOCTOR YOU SEE SAID JONES IN HIS CONSEQUENTIAL WAY </s>
<s> OUR FRIEND HERE IS A WONDERFUL MAN FOR STARTING A CHASE </s>
<s> ALL HE WANTS IS AN OLD DOG TO HELP HIM TO DO THE RUNNING DOWN </s>
<s> I HOPE A WILD GOOSE MAY NOT PROVE TO BE THE END OF OUR CHASE OBSERVED MR. MERRYWEATHER GLOOMILY </s>
<s> YOU MAY PLACE CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN MR. HOLMES SIR SAID THE POLICE AGENT LOFTILY </s>
<s> QUOTE HE HAS HIS OWN LITTLE METHODS WHICH ARE IF HE WON'T MIND MY SAYING SO JUST A LITTLE TOO THEORETICAL AND FANTASTIC BUT HE HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DETECTIVE IN HIM </s>
<s> IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT ONCE OR TWICE AS IN THAT BUSINESS OF THE SHOLTO MURDER AND THE AGRA TREASURE HE HAS BEEN MORE NEARLY CORRECT THAN THE OFFICIAL FORCE </s>
<s> OH IF YOU SAY SO MR. JONES IT IS ALL RIGHT SAID THE STRANGER WITH DEFERENCE </s>
<s> STILL I CONFESS THAT I MISS MY RUBBER </s>
<s> IT IS THE FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT FOR SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT HAD MY RUBBER </s>
<s> I THINK YOU WILL FIND SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES THAT YOU WILL PLAY FOR A HIGHER STAKE TO NIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET AND THAT THE PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING </s>
<s> FOR YOU MR. MERRYWEATHER THE STAKE WILL BE SOME THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND FOR YOU JONES IT WILL BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS QUOTE </s>
<s> JOHN CLAY THE MURDERER THIEF SMASHER AND FORGER </s>
<s> HE'S A YOUNG MAN MR. MERRYWEATHER BUT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY BRACELETS ON HIM THAN ON ANY CRIMINAL IN LONDON </s>
<s> HE'S A REMARKABLE MAN IS YOUNG JOHN CLAY </s>
<s> HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A ROYAL DUKE AND HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN TO ETON AND OXFORD </s>
<s> HIS BRAIN IS AS CUNNING.AS HIS FINGERS AND THOUGH WE MEET SIGNS OF HIM AT EVERY TURN WE NEVER KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE MAN HIMSELF </s>
<s> HE'LL CRACK A CRIB IN SCOTLAND ONE WEEK AND BE RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN CORNWALL THE NEXT </s>
<s> I'VE BEEN ON HIS TRACK FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM YET </s>
<s> I HOPE THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU TO NIGHT </s>
<s> I'VE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE TURNS ALSO WITH MR. JOHN CLAY AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION </s>
<s> IT IS PAST TEN HOWEVER AND QUITE TIME THAT WE STARTED </s>
<s> IF YOU TWO WILL TAKE THE FIRST HANSOM WATSON AND I WILL FOLLOW IN THE SECOND </s>
<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE AND LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE AFTERNOON </s>
<s> WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GAS LIT STREETS UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET </s>
<s> WE ARE CLOSE THERE NOW MY FRIEND REMARKED </s>
<s> QUOTE THIS FELLOW MERRYWEATHER IS A BANK DIRECTOR AND PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE MATTER </s>
<s> I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO HAVE JONES WITH US ALSO </s>
<s> HE IS NOT A BAD FELLOW THOUGH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE IN HIS PROFESSION </s>
<s> HE HAS ONE POSITIVE VIRTUE </s>
<s> HE IS AS BRAVE AS A BULLDOG AND AS TENACIOUS AS A LOBSTER IF HE GETS HIS CLAWS UPON ANYONE </s>
<s> HERE WE ARE AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR US </s>
<s> WE HAD REACHED THE SAME CROWDED THOROUGHFARE IN WHICH WE HAD FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MORNING </s>
<s> OUR CABS WERE DISMISSED AND FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF MR. MERRYWEATHER WE PASSED DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE AND THROUGH A SIDE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED FOR US </s>
<s> WITHIN THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR WHICH ENDED IN A VERY MASSIVE IRON GATE </s>
<s> THIS ALSO WAS OPENED AND LED DOWN A FLIGHT OF WINDING STONE STEPS WHICH TERMINATED AT ANOTHER FORMIDABLE GATE </s>
<s> MR. MERRYWEATHER STOPPED TO LIGHT A LANTERN AND THEN CONDUCTED US DOWN A DARK EARTH SMELLING PASSAGE AND SO AFTER OPENING A THIRD DOOR INTO A HUGE VAULT OR CELLAR WHICH WAS PILED ALL ROUND WITH CRATES AND MASSIVE BOXES </s>
<s> YOU ARE NOT VERY VULNERABLE FROM ABOVE HOLMES REMARKED AS HE HELD UP THE LANTERN AND GAZED ABOUT HIM </s>
<s> NOR FROM BELOW SAID MR. MERRYWEATHER STRIKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLAGS WHICH LINED THE FLOOR </s>
<s> WHY DEAR ME IT SOUNDS QUITE HOLLOW HE REMARKED LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE </s>
<s> I MUST REALLY ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET SAID HOLMES SEVERELY </s>
<s> QUOTE YOU HAVE ALREADY IMPERILLED THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPEDITION </s>
<s> MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SIT DOWN UPON ONE OF THOSE BOXES AND NOT TO INTERFERE </s>
<s> THE SOLEMN MR. MERRYWEATHER PERCHED HIMSELF UPON A CRATE WITH A VERY INJURED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE WHILE HOLMES FELL UPON HIS KNEES UPON THE FLOOR AND WITH THE LANTERN AND A MAGNIFYING LENS BEGAN TO EXARNINE MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES </s>
<s> A FEW SECONDS SUFFICED TO SATISFY HIM FOR HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND PUT HIS GLASS IN HIS POCKET </s>
<s> WE HAVE AT LEAST AN HOUR BEFORE US HE REMARKED FOR THEY CAN HARDLY TAKE ANY STEPS UNTIL THE GOOD PAWNBROKER IS SAFELY IN BED </s>
<s> THEN THEY WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE FOR THE SOONER THEY DO THEIR WORK THE LONGER TIME THEY WILL HAVE FOR THEIR ESCAPE </s>
<s> WE ARE AT PRESENT DOCTOR AS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE DIVINED IN THE CELLAR OF THE CITY BRANCH OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LONDON BANKS </s>
<s> MR. MERRYWEATHER IS THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS AND HE WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY THE MORE DARING CRIMINALS OF LONDON SHOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CELLAR AT PRESENT </s>
<s> IT IS OUR FRENCH GOLD WHISPERED THE DIRECTOR </s>
<s> WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL WARNINGS THAT AN ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE UPON IT </s>
<s> QUOTE YOUR FRENCH GOLD QUOTE </s>
<s> YES </s>
<s> WE HAD OCCASION SOME MONTHS AGO TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOURCES AND BORROWED FOR THAT PURPOSE THIRTY THOUSAND NAPOLEONS FROM THE BANK OF FRANCE </s>
<s> IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO UNPACK THE MONEY AND THAT IT IS STILL LYING IN OUR CELLAR </s>
<s> THE CRATE UPON WHICH I SIT CONTAINS TWO THOUSAND NAPOLEONS PACKED BETWEEN LAYERS OF LEAD FOIL </s>
<s> OUR RESERVE OF BULLION IS MUCH LARGER AT PRESENT THAN IS USUALLY KEPT IN A SINGLE BRANCH OFFICE AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS UPON THE SUBJECT </s>
<s> WHICH WERE VERY WELL JUSTIFIED OBSERVED HOLMES </s>
<s> AND NOW IT IS TIME THAT WE ARRANGED OUR LITTLE PLANS </s>
<s> I EXPECT THAT WITHIN AN HOUR MATTERS WILL COME TO A HEAD </s>
<s> IN THE MEANTIME MR. MERRYWEATHER WE MUST PUT THE SCREEN OVER THAT DARK LANTERN </s>
<s> QUOTE AND SIT IN THE DARK QUOTE </s>
<s> I AM AFRAID SO </s>
<s> I HAD BROUGHT A PACK OF CARDS IN MY POCKET AND I THOUGHT THAT AS WE WERE A PARTIE CARREE YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR RUBBER AFTER ALL </s>
<s> BUT I SEE THAT THE ENEMY'S PREPARATIONS HAVE GONE SO FAR THAT WE CANNOT RISK THE PRESENCE OF A LIGHT </s>
<s> AND FIRST OF ALL WE MUST CHOOSE OUR POSITIONS </s>
<s> THESE ARE DARING MEN AND THOUGH WE SHALL TAKE THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE THEY MAY DO US SOME HARM UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL </s>
<s> I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS CRATE AND DO YOU CONCEAL YOURSELVES BEHIND THOSE </s>
<s> THEN WHEN I FLASH A LIGHT UPON THEM CLOSE IN SWIFTLY </s>
<s> IF THEY FIRE WATSON HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT SHOOTING THEM DOWN </s>
<s> I PLACED MY REVOLVER COCKED UPON THE TOP OF THE WOODEN CASE BEHIND WHICH I CROUCHED </s>
<s> HOLMES SHOT THE SLIDE ACROSS THE FRONT OF HIS LANTERN AND LEFT US IN PITCH DARKNESS SUCH AN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS AS I HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED </s>
<s> THE SMELL OF HOT METAL REMAINED TO ASSURE US THAT THE LIGHT WAS STILL THERE READY TO FLASH OUT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE </s>
<s> TO ME WITH MY NERVES WORKED UP TO A PITCH OF EXPECTANCY THERE WAS SOMETHING DEPRESSING AND SUBDUING IN THE SUDDEN GLOOM AND IN THE COLD DANK AIR OF THE VAULT </s>
<s> THEY HAVE BUT ONE RETREAT WHISPERED HOLMES </s>
<s> THAT IS BACK THROUGH THE HOUSE INTO SAXE COBURG SQUARE </s>
<s> I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I ASKED YOU JONES </s>
<s> QUOTE L. HAVE AN INSPECTOR AND TWO OFFICERS WAITING AT THE FRONT DOOR QUOTE </s>
<s> THEN WE HAVE STOPPED ALL THE HOLES </s>
<s> AND NOW WE MUST BE SILENT AND WAIT </s>
<s> WHAT A TIME IT SEEMED </s>
<s> FROM COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS IT WAS BUT AN HOUR AND A QUARTER YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE NIGHT MUST HAVE ALMOST GONE. AND THE DAWN BE BREAKING ABOVE US </s>
<s> MY LIMBS WERE WEARY AND STIFF FOR I FEARED TO CHANGE MY POSITION YET MY NERVES WERE WORKED UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF TENSION AND MY HEARING WAS SO ACUTE THAT I COULD NOT ONLY HEAR THE GENTLE BREATHING OF MY COMPANIONS BUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE DEEPER HEAVIER IN BREATH OF THE BULKY JONES FROM THE THIN SIGHING NOTE OF THE BANK DIRECTOR </s>
<s> FROM MY POSITION I COULD LOOK OVER THE CASE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOOR </s>
<s> SUDDENLY MY EYES CAUGHT THE GLINT OF A LIGHT </s>
<s> AT FIRST IT WAS BUT A LURID SPARK UPON THE STONE PAVEMENT </s>
<s> THEN IT LENGTHENED OUT UNTIL IT BECAME A YELLOW LINE AND THEN WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR SOUND A GASH SEEMED TO OPEN AND A HAND APPEARED A WHITE ALMOST WOMANLY HAND WHICH FELT ABOUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE AREA OF LIGHT </s>
<s> FOR A MINUTE OR MORE THE HAND WITH ITS WRITHING FINGERS PROTRUDED OUT OF THE FLOOR </s>
<s> THEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED AND ALL WAS DARK AGAIN SAVE THE SINGLE LURID SPARK WHICH MARKED A CHINK BETWEEN THE STONES </s>
<s> ITS DISAPPEARANCE HOWEVER WAS BUT MOMENTARY </s>
<s> WITH A RENDING TEARING SOUND ONE OF THE BROAD WHITE STONES TURNED OVER UPON ITS SIDE AND LEFT A SQUARE GAPING HOLE THROUGH WHICH STREAMED THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN </s>
<s> OVER THE EDGE THERE PEEPED A CLEAN CUT BOYISH FACE WHICH LOOKED KEENLY ABOUT IT AND THEN. WITH A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE APERTURE DREW ITSELF SHOULDERHIGH AND WAIST HIGH UNTIL ONE KNEE RESTED UPON THE EDGE </s>
<s> IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOLE AND WAS HAULING AFTER HIM A COMPANION LITHE AND SMALL LIKE HIMSELF WITH A PALE FACE AND A SHOCK OF VERY RED HAIR </s>
<s> IT'S ALL CLEAR HE WHISPERED </s>
<s> HAVE YOU THE CHISEL AND THE BAGS </s>
<s> GREAT SCOTT </s>
<s> JUMP ARCHIE JUMP AND I'LL SWING FOR IT </s>
<s> SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE COLLAR </s>
<s> THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF RENDING CLOTH AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS </s>
<s> THE LIGHT FLASHED UPON THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER BUT HOLMES'S HUNTING CROP CAME DOWN ON THE MAN'S WRIST AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE FLOOR </s>
<s> QUOTE IT'S NO USE JOHN CLAY QUOTE SAID HOLMES BLANDLY </s>
<s> YOU HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL </s>
<s> SO I SEE THE OTHER ANSWERED WITH THE UTMOST COOLNESS </s>
<s> I FANCY THAT MY PAL IS ALL RIGHT THOUGH I SEE YOU HAVE GOT HIS COAT TAILS </s>
<s> THERE ARE THREE MEN WAITING FOR HIM AT THE DOOR SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> OH INDEED </s>
<s> YOU SEEM TO HAVE DONE THE THING VERY COMPLETELY </s>
<s> I MUST COMPLIMENT YOU QUOTE </s>
<s> AND I YOU HOLMES ANSWERED </s>
<s> YOUR RED HEADED IDEA WAS VERY NEW AND EFFECTIVE </s>
<s> YOU'LL SEE YOUR PAL AGAIN PRESENTLY SAID JONES </s>
<s> HE'S QUICKER AT CLIMBING DOWN HOLES THAN I AM </s>
<s> JUST HOLD OUT WHILE I FIX THE DERBIES </s>
<s> QUOTE I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT TOUCH ME WITH YOUR FILTHY HANDS QUOTE REMARKED OUR PRISONER AS THE HANDCUFFS CLATTERED UPON HIS WRISTS </s>
<s> YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT I HAVE ROYAL BLOOD IN MY VEINS </s>
<s> HAVE THE GOODNESS ALSO WHEN YOU ADDRESS ME ALWAYS TO SAY SIR AND PLEASE </s>
<s> ALL RIGHT SAID JONES WITH A STARE AND A SNIGGER </s>
<s> WELL WOULD YOU PLEASE SIR MARCH UPSTAIRS WHERE WE CAN GET A CAB TO CARRY YOUR HIGHNESS TO THE POLICE STATION </s>
<s> THAT IS BETTER SAID JOHN CLAY SERENELY </s>
<s> HE MADE A SWEEPING BOW TO THE THREE OF US AND WALKED QUIETLY OFF IN THE CUSTODY OF THE DETECTIVE </s>
<s> QUOTE REALLY MR. HOLMES QUOTE SAID MR. MERRYWEATHER AS WE FOLLOWED THEM FROM THE CELLAR QUOTE I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE BANK CAN THANK YOU OR REPAY YOU </s>
<s> THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE DETECTED AND DEFEATED IN THE MOST COMPLETE MANNER ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED ATTEMPTS AT BANK ROBBERY THAT HAVE EVER COME WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE </s>
<s> I HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE SCORES OF MY OWN TO SETTLE WITH MR. JOHN CLAY SAID HOLMES </s>
<s> I HAVE BEEN AT SOME SMALL EXPENSE OVER THIS MATTER WHICH I SHALL EXPECT THE BANK TO REFUND BUT BEYOND THAT I AM AMPLY REPAID BY HAVING HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHICH IS IN MANY WAYS UNIQUE AND BY HEARING THE VERY REMARKABLE NARRATIVE OF THE RED HEADED LEAGUE </s>
<s> YOU SEE WATSON HE EXPLAINED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AS WE SAT OVER A GLASS OF WHISKY AND SODA IN BAKER STREET IT WAS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE OBJECT OF THIS RATHER FANTASTIC BUSINESS OF THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE LEAGUE AND THE COPYING OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA MUST BE TO GET THIS NOT OVER BRIGHT PAWNBROKER OUT OF THE WAY FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS EVERY DAY </s>
<s> IT WAS A CURIOUS WAY OF MANAGING IT BUT REALLY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A BETTER </s>
<s> THE METHOD WAS NO DOUBT SUGGESTED TO CLAY'S INGENIOUS MIND BY THE COLOUR OF HIS ACCOMPLICE'S HAIR </s>
<s> THE FOUR POUNDS A WEEK WAS A LURE WHICH MUST DRAW HIM AND WHAT WAS IT TO THEM WHO WERE PLAYING FOR THOUSANDS </s>
<s> THEY PUT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE ROGUE HAS THE TEMPORARY OFFICE THE OTHER ROGUE INCITES THE MAN TO APPLY FOR IT. AND TOGETHER THEY MANAGE TO SECURE HIS ABSENCE EVERY MORNING IN THE WEEK </s>
<s> FROM THE TIME THAT I HEARD OF THE ASSISTANT HAVING COME FOR HALF WAGES IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT HE HAD SOME STRONG MOTIVE FOR SECURING THE SITUATION </s>
<s> QUOTE BUT HOW COULD YOU GUESS WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS QUOTE </s>
<s> HAD THERE BEEN WOMEN IN THE HOUSE I SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED A MERE VULGAR INTRIGUE </s>
<s> THAT HOWEVER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION </s>
<s> THE MAN'S BUSINESS WAS A SMALL ONE AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS HOUSE WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ELABORATE PREPARATIONS AND SUCH AN EXPENDITURE AS THEY WERE AT </s>
<s> IT MUST THEN BE SOMETHING OUT OF THE HOUSE </s>
<s> WHAT COULD IT BE </s>
<s> I THOUGHT OF THE ASSISTANT'S FONDNESS FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AND HIS TRICK OF VANISHING INTO THE CELLAR </s>
<s> THE CELLAR </s>
<s> THERE WAS THE END OF THIS TANGLED CLUE </s>
<s> THEN I MADE INQUIRIES AS TO THIS MYSTERIOUS ASSISTANT AND FOUND THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH ONE OF THE COOLEST AND MOST DARING CRIMINALS IN LONDON </s>
<s> HE WAS DOING SOMETHING IN THE CELLAR SOMETHING WHICH TOOK MANY HOURS A DAY FOR MONTHS ON END </s>
<s> WHAT COULD IT BE ONCE MORE </s>
<s> I COULD THINK OF NOTHING SAVE THAT HE WAS RUNNING A TUNNEL TO SOME OTHER BUILDING </s>
<s> SO FAR I HAD GOT WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT THE SCENE OF ACTION </s>
<s> I SURPRISED YOU BY BEATING UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH MY STICK </s>
<s> I WAS ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE CELLAR STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OR BEHIND </s>
<s> IT WAS NOT IN FRONT </s>
<s> THEN I RANG THE BELL AND AS I HOPED THE ASSISTANT ANSWERED IT </s>
<s> WE HAVE HAD SOME SKIRMISHES BUT WE HAD NEVER SET EYES UPON EACH OTHER BEFORE </s>
<s> I HARDLY LOOKED AT HIS FACE </s>
<s> HIS KNEES WERE WHAT I WISHED TO SEE </s>
<s> YOU MUST YOURSELF HAVE REMARKED HOW WORN WRINKLED AND STAINED THEY WERE </s>
<s> THEY SPOKE OF THOSE HOURS OF BURROWING </s>
<s> THE ONLY REMAINING POINT WAS WHAT THEY WERE BURROWING FOR </s>
<s> I WALKED ROUND THE CORNER SAW THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK ABUTTED ON OUR FRIEND'S PREMISES AND FELT THAT I HAD SOLVED MY PROBLEM </s>

<s> I ASKED </s>
<s> WELL WHEN THEY CLOSED THEIR LEAGUE OFFICES THAT WAS A SIGN THAT THEY CARED NO LONGER ABOUT MR. JABEZ WILSON'S PRESENCE IN OTHER WORDS THAT THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR TUNNEL </s>
<s> BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY SHOULD USE IT SOON AS IT MIGHT BE DISCOVERED OR THE BULLION MIGHT BE REMOVED </s>
<s> SATURDAY WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN ANY OTHER DAY AS IT WOULD GIVE THEM TWO DAYS FOR THEIR ESCAPE </s>
